CVS Organization
----------------

The CVS is organized as follows.  The HEAD of the CVS is always unstable.  Stable releases are on their own branches and
are also tagged.  Unstable releases on the HEAD may occassionally be tagged if they are a major unstable release
(such as for bug-testing before a stable release), but in general won't be tagged since they represent ongoing work.

The following stable tags exist:

The following unstable tags exist:

TODO: Releases are currently put into www/release/stable and www/release/unstable; unfortunately, these are on the HEAD,
which means that those who check out the CVS tree get every single release distributable, which can take a long time.
We really should put the release distributables themselves onto their own branch and remove them from the HEAD, so that
you only get them if you want them.  This will also involve modifying the build.xml file so that it posts automated
distributables into the release branch.
