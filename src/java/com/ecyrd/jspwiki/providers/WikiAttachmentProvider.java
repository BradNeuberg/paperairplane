 *  <P>
 *  The difference between this class and WikiPageProvider is that there
 *  PageProviders handle Unicode text, whereas we handle binary data.
 *  While there are quite a lot of similarities in how we handle
 *  things, many providers can really use just one.  In addition,
 *  since binary files can be really large, we rely on
 *  Input/OutputStreams.
