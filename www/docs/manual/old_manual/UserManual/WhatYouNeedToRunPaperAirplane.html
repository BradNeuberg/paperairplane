This connection does not have to be always on, can     be behind a firewall, and can be NATed (Network Address Translation).     <ul>      <li><b>Why:</b> A distributed application like <i>Paper Airplane</i> inherently         requires broadband; the numbers indicate that it is simply not feasible         to build the Two Way Web above a network that consists primarily of dial-up         users.</li>    </ul>  </li>  <li>1024x768 resolution     <ul>      <li><b>Why:</b> The number of UI elements can not be fit onto the screen         at 800x600 resolution</li>    </ul>  </li>  <li>Memory requirements not yet set. Probably slightly higher than the Mozilla     requirements.</li>  <li>Clockspeed requirements not yet set</li>  <li>Windows (specific versions not yet set)     <ul>      <li><b>Why:</b> While <i>Paper Airplane</i> is built on cross-platform technologies         (Mozilla, XUL, JXTA, etc.), it is simply not feasible for the small number         of current developers to build, test, and deploy <i>Paper Airplane</i>         across multiple-platforms at this time.</li>    </ul>  </li>  <li>Hard-drive requirements not yet set (will probably be pretty high)     <ul>      <li><b>Why:</b> While <i>Paper Airplane</i> is free as in money, it is not         free as in resources; your payment for using and creating within the Two         Way Web are bandwidth and hard-drive resources. The hard-drive requirements         might be quite high and will be set based on architectural network requirements.</li>    </ul>    <p>&nbsp;</p>  </li></ul><p align="right"><a href="UserManual.html">Table of Contents</a> | <a href="GoalsAndNonGoals.html">Last</a>   | <a href="MainPortionsOfPaperAirplane/MainPortionsOfPaperAirplane.html">Next</a> </p></body></html>
