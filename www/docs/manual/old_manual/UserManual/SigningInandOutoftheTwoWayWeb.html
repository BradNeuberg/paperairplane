<p><b><font size="5">Signing In and Out of the Two Way Web</font></b></p><p align="left"> Never again will you have to juggle passwords between web sites.   Instead of signing individually into each Two Way Web site, you sign into the   <i>Paper Airplane</i> browser itself when you first start:</p><p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/SignOnDialog.png" width="326" height="371"></p>
<p align="center"><i><font size="2">Sign-On Dialog</font></i></p><p align="left">As you access each Two Way Web Site, an authentication process   occurs that involves sending special keys instead of passwords. This happens   transparently and securely.</p><p><i>Paper Airplane</i> also makes it easy to have multiple user accounts to   protect the different identies you may have between Two Way Web Sites:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/ChooseUsernamePulldowninSignOnDialog.png" width="326" height="371"></p>
<p align="center"><i>Choose Username Pulldown in Sign-On Dialog</i></p><p align="left">Simply select one of the usernames to sign into the Two Way Web   with that identity. When you join or unjoin a particular Two Way Web Site it   will be with the identity that you signed in with from this dialog.</p><p align="left">To create a new account, select the <i>&lt;New User&gt;</i> identity   from the username pull-down. This will start the Registration Wizard, where   you can create a new username and password.</p><p align="left">You can have <i>Paper Airplane</i> automatically sign you in when   you first start the browser by clicking the <i>Auto-login</i> checkbox. You   can also have your password saved by checking the <i>Save password</i> checkbox.</p><p align="left">Press the <b>Sign On</b> button after entering your username and   password to sign onto the Two Way Web. A dialog window will appear showing the   status as the <i>Paper Airplane</i> browser attempts to sign on:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/SignOnStatus.png" width="500" height="371"></p>
<p align="center"><i><font size="2">Sign-On Status</font></i></p><p align="left">If a step fails the bubble will fill with red instead of black.   Press the <b>Cancel</b> button to abandon the signing on; if pressed you will   return to the Sign-On dialog.</p><p align="left"><b>Technical Tip: </b>When you enter your password it is never   actually sent on to the Internet. Instead, your password is used to unlock a   special file on your machine that contains a <i>private key</i>. When you used   the Registration Wizard a <i>public key</i> and a <i>private key</i> were given   to you. A public key is freely given to other people on the Internet; it is   non-private and others can use it to contact and verify information you create.   A private key is held only on your machine, and is used so that others can verify   your identity. The <i>Paper Airplane</i> browser hides this information from   you. </p><p align="left"><b>Advanced Tip: </b>If you would like to move your private key   to a new machine or back it up in case your hard-drive crashes, use the Windows   Explorer to navigate to the directory <b><i>[insert directory when client is   finished]</i></b> and copy the entire directory <b><i>[insert username directory   when client is finished]</i></b> to another machine or to a floppy disk; be   careful not to place this file on the open Internet where others can copy it!   If someone gains access to both your password and this file they can pretend   that they are you. On the new machine install <i>Paper Airplane, </i>use Windows   Explorer to navigate to the directory <b><i>[insert directory when client is   finished]</i></b>, and copy the directory you backed up earlier to this directory.   Restart the <i>Paper Airplane</i> browser.</p><p align="left">While browsing the username that you signed in with is displayed   in the <i>Account Info and Sign Off Area</i>:</p>

<p align="center"> <font size="2"><i>Account Info and Sign Off Area</i></font></p><p align="left">To sign off press the <b>Sign Off</b> button. The Sign-On dialog   will appear. You can now exit <i>Paper Airplane</i> or sign-in with a different   username. </p>
