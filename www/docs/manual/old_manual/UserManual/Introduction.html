<p><i>Paper Airplane</i> is a non-commercial web browser that makes these promises 
  true by radically including everything needed to author and view web sites for 
  free. It fuses a web browser, a powerful word-processor, and a peer-to-peer 
  web server together to create the Two Way Web. <i>Paper Airplane</i> sledgehammers 
  the Two Way Web Sites it creates, smashing them into hundreds of fragments that 
  are securely stored across a multitude of machines in a process known as peer-to-peer. 
  Choose from hundreds of new domain endings for your site, such as .politics, 
  .fan, .religion, .gay, or .environment. Want to create a web-site named <i>www.Nike.laborpolicy</i>, 
  <i>www.CodingInParadise.weblog</i>, or <i>www.DallasCowboys.fan</i>? Go for 
  it. Finally, <i>Paper Airplane</i> includes an advanced What You Create Is What 
  Your Users See (WYCIWYUS) office suite that can create word processing documents, 
  spreadsheets, presentations, and more. Best of all, <i>Paper Airplane</i> is 
  free in every sense of the word: free to download, free to create sites and 
  domain names, and free as in open-source. </p>
<p><b>Use <i>Paper Airplane</i> to browse the World Wide Web or pages on the new 
  Two Way Web:</b></p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/ViewingaNikeLaborPolicyPage2.png" width="1024" height="768"></p>

  Way Web that match your interests:</b></p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/TheTwoWayWebDirectory.png" width="1024" height="768"></p>
<p>The engine underlying the features in <i>Paper Airplane</i> is a new kind of 
  organic, grassroots web site, known as a Two Way Web Site. These new sites are 
  advanced, online communities that completely integrate the tools necessary to 
  create, maintain, and share content. They provide a host of abilities far beyond 
  older web-sites: single-sign on, integration of all the tools needed for editing 
  and creating content in the browser such as a powerful word processor and wizards, 
  and site members and member roles.</p>
<p><b>The <i>New Site Wizard</i> makes it easy to create new web sites. Your new 
  web site is saved on the peer-to-peer Two Way Web rather than on a server or 
  on your own machine:</b></p>
<p><img src="images/TheNewSiteWizardMakesItEasyToCreate.png" width="1024" height="768"></p>
<p><b>Easily find out who the members of a Two Way Web Sites are or new changes 
  to the site by using the bundled Members and New Changes sidebars:</b></p>

<p>The Old Web stores web sites on centralized servers that are expensive and   difficult to maintain; <i>Paper Airplane</i> smashes Two Way Web Sites into   hundreds of fragments that are securely stored across a multitude of machines.   When a Two Way Web Site is requested, the fragments coalesce like drops of mercury   in a process known as peer-to-peer. This peer-to-peer process makes it possible   to create new Two Way Web Sites for free. Instead of pulling out a credit-card   and configuring a web-server, you simply save your pages just as you save documents   in your word processor today. No fuss no muss.</p>
<p><i>Paper Airplane</i> colorizes the monotone domain name system. Your world 
  isn't just about .COMpanies, .EDUcational institutions, or .ORGanizations, so 
  why should the web? <i>Paper Airplan</i>e adds more than a hundred free new 
  domain endings, such as .religion, .fan, .sucks, .love, .cooperative, .gay, 
  .marryme, .politics, .environment, and more. Plus, you can create your own ending 
  without asking anyone's permission. </p>
<p><i>Paper Airplane</i> finally frees us from the tyranny of HTML by integrating 
  a powerful editor. Gone are endless nights spent trying to get web pages to 
  look the same across many different browsers; with the <i>Paper Airplane </i>editor, 
  What You Create Is What Your Users See (WYCIWYUS). <i>Paper Airplane</i> achieves 
  this by replacing the aging, crusty HTML file-format with a new format that 
  better encodes how your documents look on the screen. Easily drag-and-drop images 
  from your desktop into your document and freely position them in your page without 
  using HTML hacks like tables. Use columns to create advanced online newsletters. 
  You will fall in love with the powerful AutoLink feature, which transforms creating 
  hyperlinks into a stream of consciousness. Even better, since <i>Paper Airplane's</i> 
  editor is fully integrated into the browser, getting work done productively 
  and efficiently is faster and easier than it's ever been. If you have the proper 
  permissions, editing a page is as simple as clicking the <b>Edit Page</b> button 
  located on every Two Way Web page. And remember, because other site member's 
  can also edit through their <i>Paper Airplane</i> browser, web pages become 
  more like discussions and less like the strait-jackets they are today.</p>
<p><b>To edit a page in a Two Way Web Site, simply press the <i>Edit Page </i>button 
  in the browser:</b></p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/ViewModeToolBarandThrobber.png" width="1015" height="44"></p>
<p><b>Creating new pages is just as easy; simply press the <i>New Page</i> button 
  and select what kind of page you wish to start with:</b></p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/ChooseaNewBaseDocument.png" width="326" height="371"></p>
<p><b>Use the powerful <i>Paper Airplane</i> editor to make changes to pages; 
  add spreadsheets, drawings, and more:</b></p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/EditingDoingBusinessinBangkok2.png" width="870" height="740"></p>
<p><b>When you are finished editing, simply select <i>Save</i> from the File menu; 
  your page will be transparently saved onto your web site in the peer-to-peer 
  network and can now be viewed by other people:</b></p>

<p>Did we also mention that the <i>Paper Airplane</i> browser itself is also completely 
  open-source? Need to customize a feature or have an idea for a business centered 
  around <i>Paper Airplane</i>? Go for it.</p>
