<p><b><font size="5">What is this Document?</font></b> </p><p>This document serves several different functions. First, it provides an <a href="Introduction.html">Introduction</a>   and a <a href="Walkthrough/Walkthrough.html">Walkthrough</a> for new user's   to get up to speed on what <i>Paper Airplane</i> and the Two Way Web are all   about. Second, it acts as the complete help file for using and interacting with   the <i>Paper Airplane</i> application. Third, it is the functional requirements   document describing exactly what <i>Paper Airplane</i> 1.0&nbsp;and the Two   Way Web will consist of and what it will not consist of. Finally, this document   provides the user-interface description, screenshots, and brand identity needed   to create and market the <i>Paper Airplane</i> application.</p><p><b>Please note that neither <i>Paper Airplane</i> nor The Two Way Web exist   yet; the screenshots in this document are only mockups.</b></p><p>If you are looking for the following information, you will need to consult   other documents than this one:</p><ul>  <li><b><i>Paper Airplane</i> Security Analysis</b> - This document analyzes     various security issues, such as possible security holes inherited with the     open-source codebases of Mozilla, gobeProductive, JXTA, etc., the possible     motives of attackers to understand what portions of the architecture will     be most attractive for hacking, portions of the architecture susceptible to     Denial of Service (DoS) attacks, and more.</li>  <li><b><i>Paper Airplane</i> Architecture</b> - This document provides the blueprints     for how the <i>Paper Airplane</i> client application works. It does not include     how the peer-to-peer distributed architecture of the Two Way Web will operate;     instead, it describes generic interfaces behind which the actual peer to peer     code will operate. This document instead discusses the components that are     needed for the <i>Paper Airplane</i> client portion and their organization,     interfaces to these components, how user-interface code will be arranged,     etc.</li>  <li><b>Two Way Web Architecture</b> - This document describes the distributed     peer to peer architecture of the Two Way Web, including distributed naming,     storage, and PKI, how the code that implements this architecture is implemented     on the client, and the API that is exposed to the <i>Paper Airplane</i> browser.</li></ul>
