One of the major goals   of<i> Paper Airplane</i> is to transform creating Two Way Web Sites into acts   of conversation rather than technical tinkering and configuring. When we have   conversations with other people, we refer to concepts and documents by their   names, such as <i>&quot;What about doing business in Bangkok?&quot;</i> or <i>&quot;Make   sure to see the third quarter financial results</i>.&quot; When we are on the   older web, we are forced to modify how we have conversations by using complex   and technical URLs. For example, to ask the previous questions in the context   of a web page, one would have to type <i>&quot;What about http://www.bangkok.com/DoingBusiness.html?&quot;   </i>or <i>&quot;Make sure to see http://www.acme.com/financial/ThirdQuarter.xls</i>.&quot;</p><p><i>Paper Airplane</i> changes this by making the act of creating hyperlinks   as transparent as thinking. To hyperlink to any other page on a Two Way Web   Site, all a user needs to do is surround a page name with two open brackets,   such as [[, and two closed brackets, such as ]]. For example, if the user types   <i>What about [[doing business in bangkok]]?</i> in the <i>Paper Airplane</i>   editor, <i>doing business in bangkok </i>is automatically hyperlinked to point   to a page with that name:</p><p align="center"><img src="../images/AutoLink1.png" width="500" height="100" border="1"></p><p align="center"><i><font size="2">Beginning to type 'doing business in bangkok'...</font></i></p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p><p align="center"><img src="../images/AutoLink2.png" width="500" height="100" border="1"></p><p align="center"><i><font size="2">Typed closing double-brackets...</font></i></p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p><p align="center"><img src="../images/AutoLink3.png" width="500" height="100" border="1"></p><p align="center"><i><font size="2">Instantly, the brackets disappear and a link   is created to a page with that name</font></i></p><p>The brackets disappear after being typed to make the hyperlink look more natural.</p><p>If a page name doesn't exist but was surrounded with brackets, then the word   <b>Create Page </b>is placed after the hyperlink in parentheses:</p><p align="center"><img src="../images/AutoLink4.png" width="500" height="100" border="1"></p><p align="center"><i><font size="2">Just finished typing the final double-brackets...</font></i></p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p><p align="center"><img src="../images/AutoLink5.png" width="500" height="100" border="1"></p><p align="center"><i><font size="2">Instantly, the brackets disappear, the text   between the brackets is underlined as a hyperlink, and <b>(create page)</b></font></i><b><i>   </i></b><i>is added</i><b><i> <br>  </i></b></p><p>When the new hyperlink is clicked on, a new <i>Paper Airplane</i> editor window   opens with a blank page automatically named from the AutoLinked name.</p><p>Page's on other Two Way Web Sites can also be referenced. For example, if a   user types <i>Make sure to see the interesting things going on at [[www.CodingInParadise.weblog:   Why you should use open-source software]]</i>, then a hyperlink is automatically   created to the page <i>Why you should use open-source software</i> on the Two   Way Web Site <i>www.CodingInParadise.weblog</i>. </p><p>The simple idea of AutoLinking now makes creating pages and hyperlinks much   more like conversation. For example, imagine the following scenario. First,   imagine that a page named<i> First Quarter Financials </i>already exists on   a Two Way Web Site named <i>www.Acme.company</i>. Someone creates a page named   <i>Discussion Of First Quarter Financials</i>, and begins typing some critical   comments of the first quarter financials. As they are typing their criticisms,   they decide that they would like to create a list of ways to correct problems   identified in the future; to start creating this, they merely refer to a page   with a name along those lines, such as <i>[[how to correct first quarter problems]].   </i>Now this user can simply click the automatic hyperlink added to <i>how to   correct first quarter problems </i>to begin creating the <i>How To Correct First   Quarter Problems </i>page.</p><p>This process can continue spinning out, with pages being organically created   and refered to without ever touching an http:// or moving away from concepts.<br>  <br>  For more in-depth information see <a href="../ThePowerofAutoLinking.html">The   Power of AutoLinking</a>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align="right"><a href="../UserManual.html">Table of Contents</a> | <a href="AFullOfficeSuiteAtYourFingers.html">Last</a>   | <a href="PowerfulIntegrationWithWindows.html">Next</a> </p></body></html>
