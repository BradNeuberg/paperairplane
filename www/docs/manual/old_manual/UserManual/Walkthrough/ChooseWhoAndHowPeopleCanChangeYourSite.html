Three roles are available for your site's members: Managers,   Members, and Non-Members.</p><p>The most powerful role are the Managers. Managers authorize new members and   remove old members, edit and delete pages created by anyone, and can set anyone's   role; basicly they are authorizers and deleters of content. Next come the Members.   Members are still powerful, but have some restrictions. They can create and   rename pages but can't delete pages. They can also edit any page. </p><p>Non-Members are the final and least-powerful role. They can simply view content,   if the site itself is public. They are simply the viewers; they can look through   the glass window at the candy-store but can't get in.</p><p>Moving members between roles is easy. First, press the <b>Members </b>button:</p><p align="center"><img src="../images/TheMembersButton.png" width="61" height="45"></p><p align="center"><i><font size="2">The <b>Members</b> Button</font></i></p><p>This will show the Members panel in the Sidebar:</p><p align="center"><img src="../images/TheMembersPanelintheSidebar.png" width="1024" height="768"></p><p align="center"><i><font size="2">The Members Panel in the Sidebar</font></i></p><p><br>  To transform a Member into a Manager, for example, simply drag the desired username   from the Member's category to the Manager's category. Only Managers can perform   these roles changes. Managers can also force Members to become Non-Members by   selecting their names in the Membership Sidebar and pressing the <b>Remove</b>   button.</p><p>Adding and authorizing new members is easy as well. If Non-Members have asked   to join, their names will show up in the Member's Sidebar under the heading   <i>Waiting to be Approved</i>. </p><p align="center"><b><img src="../images/WaitingtobeApprovedAreaCircled.png" width="1024" height="768"></b></p><p align="center"><i><font size="2">Waiting to be Approved Area Circled</font></i></p><p>Simply select the potential members to approve and press the <b>Approve</b>   button. A dialog will appear asking if you would like these new users to be   Members or Managers.</p><p>To add a member, simply press the <b>+ </b>button:</p><p align="center"><b><img src="../images/PlusButtonCircled.png" width="213" height="311"></b></p><p align="center"><i><font size="2"><b>+</b> Button Circled</font></i></p><p>A <i>&lt;New Member&gt; </i>entry will appear in the Members area, with the   cursor flashing and ready for you to type the new Member's name:</p><p align="center"><img src="../images/AddingNewMemberinMembersSidebar.png" width="213" height="392"></p><p align="center"><i><font size="2">Ading New Member in Member's Sidebar</font></i></p><p>For more in-depth information see <a href="../AdministeringYourTwoWayWebSites.html">Administering   Your Two Way Web Sites</a>.</p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p><p align="right"><a href="../UserManual.html">Table of Contents</a> | <a href="DomainNamesAreDeadLongLiveDomainNames.html">Last</a>   | <a href="AFullOfficeSuiteAtYourFingers.html">Next</a> </p></body></html>
