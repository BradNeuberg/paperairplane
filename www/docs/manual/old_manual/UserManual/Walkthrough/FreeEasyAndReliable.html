Simply   start up the<i> Paper Airplane</i> browser and use the included wizards to create   a Two Way Web Site. It's as simple as that.</p><p>Two Way Web Sites are also completely free to create and administer. While   <i>Paper Airplane</i> is free in terms of money, every participant must still   &#147;pay&#148; some of their computer's space and bandwidth to store pieces   of the Two Way Web. The net result of this is that the web is transformed into   a giant, free hard-drive, where creating sites and pages is as easy as clicking   your mouse. As users sign in and out of the peer-to-peer Two Way Web, site pieces   are moved between peers to maintain reliability. Since <i>Paper Airplane</i>   also banishes centralized servers, hordes of system administrators are also   not needed to maintain your web site. You can turn off your machine without   the fear that your web site will disappear.</p><p>Some companies spend millions of dollars to create replicated server farms,   setting up portions of their web sites in far-flung locations such as Tokyo   and California to ensure that if disaster befalls an area the web site will   keep on ticking. You get this kind of reliability for free with <i>Paper Airplane</i>.   Two Way Web Sites are broken into hundreds of pieces and spread across the earth   on the hard-drives of other people running the <i>Paper Airplane</i> browser.   Each piece is encrypted to prevent tampering on the personal computer it is   stored on, and multiple copies of the piece are made to ensure that if one user   signs off of <i>Paper Airplane</i> that portion will still be available. When   users request your Two Way Web Site, pieces will began re-assembling themselves   from all over the globe. If a portion has been tampered with or changed, the   <i>Paper Airplane</i> browser will detect this and invalidate that piece. Even   if some storage personal computers are knocked out or some are overwhelmed,   your web site will keep on trucking. Now you can have the reliability of the   Fortune 500 without spending millions of dollars.</p><p>For more information on <i>Paper Airplane's</i> distributed storage see the   Paper Airplane Architectural document <b><i>[Add link when architectural document   is finished]</i></b>.</p><p align="right"><a href="../UserManual.html">Table of Contents</a> | <a href="SeamlessCollaboration.html">Last</a>   | <a href="CreateNewTwoWayWebSitesWithTheClickOfAButton.html">Next</a> </p><p>&nbsp; </p></body></html>
