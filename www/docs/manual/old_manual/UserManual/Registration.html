The Registration Wizard explains what <i>Paper   Airplane </i>is, makes it possible to choose a unique username, and allows you   to choose a password.</p><p>Every user in the Two Way Web has a unique username, such as <i>BradNeuberg</i>   or <i>Huckleberry</i>. Special security information, known as a <i>public</i>   and a <i>private</i> key, are associated with each of these usernames, and are   used to ensure that if someone claims they are a certain user that they can   be validated as that user. Registration is completely free, and information   such as your real name or email address are not associated with you or stored   on foreign servers.</p><p>Rather than signing into each Two Way Web Site you visit, you only have to   sign into the <i>Paper Airplane</i> browser once when you run the program. Afterwards   you are automatically signed into each Two Way Web Site.</p><p><b>Important:</b> In the <i>Paper Airplane </i>1.0 release you are restricted   to signing in from the computer you registered your account with. This is because   special security information is stored on your local computer, rather than on   a centralized machine. You can not sign-in using an account from an Internet   cafe, for example, unless you setup your account from that cafe. </p><p>The two steps of the Registration Wizard explain why you would want to use   <i>Paper Airplane:</i></p><p align="center"><img src="images/RegistrationWizardStep1.png" width="608" height="475"></p><p align="center"><i><font size="2">Registration Wizard Step 1</font></i></p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p><p align="center"><img src="images/RegistrationWizardStep2.png" width="608" height="475"></p><p align="center"><i><font size="2">Registration Wizard Step 2</font></i> </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A small ticker tape, in the white field above, shows a continious stream of   possible Two Way Web Site names in the second step of the Registration Wizard.</p><p>As you progress through the Registration Wizard the tiny circles in the upper-right   will fill in:</p><p align="center"><img src="images/WizardBubbles.png" width="150" height="26"></p><p align="center"><i><font size="2">Wizard Bubbles</font></i></p><p>In the third step you can choose a username:</p><p align="center"><img src="images/RegistrationWizardStep3.png" width="608" height="475"></p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p><p>Your username can be anywhere from three characters to thirty characters and   can have letters, spaces, and numbers. However, they must start with a letter   rather than a space or number. Your username is case-insensitive, which means   that <i>Fidget666, fidget666, </i>and <i>FiDgEt666 </i>all refer to the same   person.</p><p>Press the <b>OK </b>button when you have chosen your username. <i>Paper Airplane</i>   will now sign into the Two Way Web to see if that username is available. Status   information is presented as this process occurs:</p><p align="center"><img src="images/RegistrationWizardStep3foraGoodUsername.png" width="608" height="475"></p><p align="center"><i><font size="2">Registration Wizard Step 3 for a Good Username</font></i></p><p>If a step is successful, such as being able to contact the Two Way Web, then   a black circle will appear next to that step. If a step fails, for example if   a username is already taken, then the circle will become filled with red. The   reason for the failure will also be printed in red next to the circle:</p><p align="center"><img src="images/RegistrationWizardStep3foraUsernamethatisAlreadyTaken.png" width="608" height="475"></p><p align="center"><i><font size="2">Registration Wizard Step 3 for a Username   that is Already Taken</font></i></p><p>If a username is already taken, an alternative username will be suggested in   the username field that is still available.</p><p>If the username is available, then the word <b>Finished!</b> will appear. You   can now press the <b>Next</b> button to progress to the next step, which is   choosing a password:</p><p align="center"><img src="images/RegistrationWizardStep4.png" width="608" height="475"></p><p align="center"><i><font size="2">Registration Wizard Step 4</font></i></p><p align="left">After choosing a password, the Two Way Web will be contacted and   your account will be created:</p><p align="center"><img src="images/RegistrationWizardStep5.png" width="608" height="475"></p><p align="center"><i><font size="2">Registration Wizard Step 5</font></i></p><p>If everything goes correctly, the <b>OK</b> button will become enabled.
