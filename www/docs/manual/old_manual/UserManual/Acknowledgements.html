<p><b><font size="5">Acknowledgements</font></b></p><p> </p><p><b><font size="4">Software Acknowledgements</font></b></p><p><i>Paper Airplane</i> is inspired by and depends on the software innovations   of many other people. Thank you very much to:</p><ul>  <li><b>Ward Cunningham</b> for <b>WikiWikiWeb</b>. WikiWiki is the most important     ancestor of <i>Paper Airplane</i>.
Ward showcased a huge number of innovations:     the power of making every
page editable, using AutoMagic and WikiNames for     organic site growth,
the crazy yet profound idea of having web sites that     are completely open
for users to grow and change, and the simple concept of     bundling the
tools necessary to change a site with the site itself. Thank     you Ward
for transforming what the web is about.</li>  <li><b>Mozilla.org</b> and <b>Netscape/AOL</b> for <b>Mozilla</b>. Without Mozilla     <i>Paper Airplane</i> would not be possible. <i>Paper Airplane</i>
directly     uses the Mozilla source code, including its profound technical
innovations     such as XUL, to make this a feasible project. Thank you for
producing such     a fast, full-featured, standards-compliant web browser.</li>  <li><b>gobe</b> for <b>gobeProductive</b>. <i>Paper Airplane</i>
is directly     powered by the full-featured gobeProductive office suite.
Thank you for such     an amazing suite of tools that redefines what office
packages should be.</li>  <li><b>JXTA.org</b>, <b>Bill Joy</b>, and <b>Mike Clary</b> for <b>JXTA</b>.     Without JXTA, <i>Paper Airplane</i>
would not be possible. JXTA solves a many     of the hard-problems of creating
a peer to peer system, such as building an     elegant, virtual networking
layer above firewalled and NATed peers, and more.     Thank you for such
a well-documented and powerful system.</li></ul><p> </p><p><b><font size="4">Personal Acknowledgements</font></b></p><ul>  <li>Thanks

you.</li>  <li>Thanks to my mom for all the gifts she's given me: strength,
will-power,     openness, friendliness, stubborness, and anger. This project
