<p align="left"><b><font size="5">Notes on the Distributed Domain Name System   (DisDNS) </font></b></p><p align="left">The Distributed Domain Name System (DisDNS) is a new alternative   to the existing, semi-centralized Domain Name System (DNS). The most striking   difference between DisDNS and DNS is the fact that the DisDNS system is completely   peer-to-peer; just as Two Way Web pages are stored in a reliable away across   all of the Paper Airplane browsers currently running, the DisDNS system is setup   to reliably exist even in the face of an unreliable and potentially hostile   peer network.</p><p>The DisDNS system does not handle any of the existing DNS domain endings. Instead,   domain names with the following DNS domain endings are handed to an alternative   DNS root, such as AlterNic, to be resolved:</p><p>ad, aero, af, al, am, as, at, au, az, ba, be, bg, biz, bm, br, bt, by, ca,   cc, ch, ck, cn, com, coop, cx, cy, cz, de, dk, dz, edu, ee, eg, es, fi, fo,   fr, ga, gb, ge, gf, gi, gl, gm, gov, gr, gs, hk, hm, hr, hu, id, ie, il, in,   info, int, io, is, it, jo, jp, kr, kz, li, lk, lt, lu, lv, ly, ma, mc, md, mil,   mk, ms, mt, museum, mx, name, net, nl, no, nu, nz, org, pe, pk, pl, pr, pro,   pt, pw, ro, ru, se, sg, sh, si, sk, sm, so, st, su, tc, tf, th, tj, tm, tn,   to, tr, tw, ua, uk, us, va, ve, vg, yu, za</p><p>Note that the existing VeriSign/ICANN root-servers are completely bypassed;   while <i>Paper Airplane</i> defers resolution of existing DNS names to the DNS   system, ICANN is not respected and alternative root servers are used. Also note   that Two Way Web Sites can not be created that have domain endings that are   currently used in the list above. <i>Paper Airplane</i> will not use the DNS   system for resolution on any domain name endings that may be added in the future   whether they are added by ICANN or the alternative root organization that is   used. DNS is only used for legacy domain ending resolution, and DisDNS is considered   the future for domain endings. Further, it is not a design goal for DisDNS to   be backwards compatible with DNS in such a way that DNS can resolve against   DisDNS. </p><p>The DisDNS system is configured with hundreds of new domain endings, such as   .company and .politics. Further, adding new domain endings is completely open   to anyone, and is easily done through the <i>Paper Airplane</i> user-interface.   The DisDNS system should have safeguards against automated, malicious creation   of new endings to prevent Denail of Service, perhaps with hashcash or thinkcash;   this is an architectural issue and is discussed in the Two Way Web Architecture   document.</p><p>Unlike DNS, DisDNS domain names are internationalized; the exact details of   internationalization are discussed in the Two Way Web Architecture document.   Allowed characters are alphabetical characters, numbers, dashes, and spaces.   Superflous periods (other than the domain endings period), are not allowed.</p><p>Domain name endings in the DisDNS system are free and are handed out on a first-come,   first-served basis. In order to prevent abuse or domain name hoarding, every   Two Way Web Site may only have one DisDNS domain name. The system should also   prevent against rapid automated creation of Two Way Web Sites, and hence hoarded   DisDNS domain names, by using a scheme such as hashcash or thinkcash; this is   considered an architectural decision and is discussed in the Two Way Web Architecture   document.</p><p>Unlike DNS, DisDNS domain names are only one level deep, such as <i>StarryNight.poetry</i>   or <i>CodingInParadise.weblog</i>. For example, <i>a-subdomain.CodingInParadise.weblog</i>   could not be stored in the DisDNS system. There are several reasons for this   limitation. The first is KISS: we simply don't need multiple domain levels for   <i>Paper Airplane</i>, and designing them in is yet another function point.   Further, there are security and control issues that are not easy to solve; for   example, if you created the Two Way Web Site named <i>CodingInParadise.weblog</i>,   should you be the only one who gets to create <i>mail.CodingInParadise.weblog</i>?   Should other Managers on that site be able to create that subdomain? Further,   these issues get confusing with domain endings that have subdomains, such as   .music.hiphop and .music.classical, that aren't controlled by anyone. Too many   problems for too little payoff.</p><p>You might have noticed that there is one exception to this rule, however. Every   Two Way Web Site address begins with the letters www, such as <i>www.codinginparadise.weblog</i>   or <i>www.nike.laborpolicy</i>. The <i>www </i>was added after usability testing   showed that user's didn't realize these were web-site names until a www was   added at the beginning; these are syntactic sugar that don't have any real meaning.</p><p>At this time DisDNS names can not be configured to point to existing World   Wide Web sites due to difficult issues that are outside the scope of <i>Paper   Airplane</i> 1.0.</p><p><b><i>[After resolving mapping of services to Two Way Web URLs, such as the   directory service or other Peer Group services, put that info here; this will   be done only after the Two Way Web Architecture document is fleshed out]</i></b></p>
