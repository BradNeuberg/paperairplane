They also use     Microsoft Word to create web pages, but are dissatisfied with it's HTML output     and difficulty in transfering as email attachments. However, they:</li>  <ul>    <li><b>Don't</b> have a graphic design background</li>    <li><b>Don't</b> use sophisticated web creation tools such as Macromedia Dreamweaver</li>  </ul>  <li>They have a beginners understanding of what peer to peer is after using     or hearing about Napster, but:</li>  <ul>    <li><b>Don't</b> feel comfortable with the existing crop of peer to peer file       <i>storage</i> applications (as opposed to peer to peer file <i>sharing</i>       applications) due to complicated user-interfaces. They are most likely not       even aware of the existence of these applications, such as Mnet, The Circle,       Chord, etc.</li>  </ul>  <li>They are sophisticated in a creative and political sense, but have only     recently begun to understand how they can transfer this side into use on the     Internet. </li>  <li>They might be beginning to grasp how powerful Internet communities can be,     and have some interest in establishing one for their own particular interests.</li>  <li>They enjoy their computers enough, and do enough file sharing using applications     such as LimeWire or Kazaa, that they have a broadband connection</li>  <li>They use Windows and have a suitably powerful computer</li>  <li>They understand the following words or concepts: the web, web page, URL,     web address, web-site, word processor, document, web browser, save, create,     collaboration, online communities.</li>  <li>They <b>don't</b> set up web servers or use HTML.</li>  <li>They can purchase a domain name online, but hosting it and entering the     values needed to configure it is difficult and annoying.</li>  <li>They prefer integration and ease of use over power</li></ul><p>Intermediate computer users should feel liberated by <i>Paper Airplane</i>   and prefer it over the competition: setting up a traditional web server, using   Microsoft Word and distributing Word files using email attachments, setting   up a Content Management System or groupware solution, etc.</p><p>The following types of users are <i>not</i> the targets of <i>Paper Airplane</i>;   they would either feel constrained by <i>Paper Airplane</i> or confused:</p><ul>  <li><b>Naive users</b></li>  <li><b>Sophisticated Users</b></li>  <li><b>Professional Graphic Designers</b></li>  <li><b>Computer Gurus</b></li></ul><p>Each of these types of users is defined below.</p><p>A <b>Naive User</b> is someone who predominantly uses AOL, if they even go   online. They are afraid of computers. They don't use Microsoft Word, and don't   know what a word processor is. They don't even know what a browser is. When   they touch a mouse they handle it like it is a delicate piece of machinery that   will break at the slightest slip. If they are forced to use a computer, they   attempt to minimize the amount of time they spend on it.</p><p>A <b>Sophisticated User</b> has technical or semi-technical training. They   are comfortable setting up their own web-servers. They may have begun playing   around with server-side scripting, such as PHP or ASP, but definently haven't   done server-side object-oriented programming using languages such as Java. They   have basic to intermediate system administration skills, such as configuring   a DNS server or editing the scripts needed for Apache. They enjoy tinkering   around and being unconstrained by a graphical user-interface.</p><p>A <b>Professional Graphic Designer</b>&nbsp;wants to maximize the aesthetic   or interactive value of their web pages and web sites versus communication and   editability. They use powerful tools, such as Adobe Photoshop and Macromedia   Dreamweaver. They expect maximum control over presentation, and have a large   amount of experience in designing and creating web sites and web pages. They   are visual individuals versus verbal individuals. They are relatively satisfied   with the existing web, but would balk at using the <i>Paper Airplane</i> editor   since it promotes discursive, verbal sites over visual ones and doesn't support   the HTML tricks they are used to.</p><p>A <b>Computer Guru</b> is anyone above a sophisticated user. They might be   professional server-side Java programmers, extremely knowledgeable Linux system   administrators and users, etc. They are comfortable with the existing architecture   of the web as it suits their needs and knowledge well. They are comfortable   with powerful but complex user-interfaces, scriptability, and configurability.   They expect maximum flexibility, preferably without a GUI. They also understand   existing security concepts, such as public-key crytography, webs of trust, certificates,   revocation, etc. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align="right"><a href="UserManual.html">Table of Contents</a> | <a href="Walkthrough/BrowseTheExistingWorldWideWebWithCuttingEdgeStandards.html">Last</a>   | <a href="ValuesPhilosophyAndMarketing.html">Next</a> </p></body></html>
