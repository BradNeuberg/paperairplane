Branding is truly   a terrible word, and unfortunately it is an appropriate one for how many corporations   have used it. Done something wrong? Quick, hire a PR firm to create marketing   that spins away your transgression. Branding isn't simply a stamp that you attach   to the outside of something; it is you. </p><p><i>Paper Airplane</i> is taking a different approach to branding, one that   really should be called authenticity. Branding should simply be your values   and focus, amplified. It should represent what you are truly about, and communicate   these ideas through your name and visually through your user-interface. Your   organization's actions should be consistent with these goals and admit to failing   when they are not. Brand identity is about your philosophy, and not about your   b.s.</p><p><br>  So what are the core values and focus of <i>Paper Airplane</i> that will be   authentically communicated through naming, logo, visual design, etc? Listed   below are the heady goals that <i>Paper Airplane</i> attempts to deliver and   stick by:</p><ul>  <li>Creating, maintaining, and sharing on the web should feel like seamless     magic.</li>  <li>Freedom of speech doesn't truly exist unless affordable&nbsp;freedom of     speech exists. </li>  <li>Ordinary people should have access to affordable freedom of speech in mass     communication and not just on street corners.</li>  <li>Users should have the ability to comment on the powerful</li>  <li>Reduce what used to take several days (propagating domain name changes,     setting up web servers) to single, instant clicks</li>  <li>Any sufficiently advanced technology should be indistinguisable from magic</li>  <li>Creating online communities should be as easy as creating files and folders     on your hard-drive</li>  <li>Creating web pages should be as easy as using word procesors such as Microsoft     Word</li>  <li>Web sites should become discussions, and discussions should become web sites</li>  <li>Every member should have the tools they need to become <i>creators</i> and     not simply <i>viewers</i></li>  <li>We need parts of our lives that aren't dictated by the free-market</li>  <li>Our creative, spiritual, and political identities are more important than     our role as consumers</li>  <li>Innovators should be able to tinker with ideas that go outside the paradigm     of capitalism.</li>  <li>Powerful technologies, such as peer to peer distributed storage, should     be hidden by simple, accessible user-interfaces</li>  <li>Top-down decentralized integration to provide bottom-up, organic growth,     i.e., create a loose-structure that everyone plays by to ensure fairness.</li>  <li>Users should be freed from web monopolies (Microsoft IE and Word, ICANN,     web-storage companies, sys-admins)</li>  <li>Freeing users from menial knowledge (how to set up a web-server, coding     HTML, etc.) to allow them to focus on higher-order knowledge (creativity,     politics, etc.)</li>  <li>Ultra-low barrier of entry for creativity, politics, and discussion (free     web-sites and pages, no centralization, open-source app, etc.)</li>  <li>Web sites should be dialogic and provide for a spectrum of voices</li>  <li>Content Management System for the masses</li>  <li>Browsers shouldn't just have editors, they should have powerful editors</li>  <li>Discussion should happen at the level of concepts and communities without     having to deal with technical plumbing</li>  <li>Boundaries are important, so is letting go of them. The full range of boundaries     around a community should be supported.</li>  <li>The browser should support organic growth</li>  <li>User's should not have to learn a new user-interface for every web-site</li></ul><p><i>Paper Airplane</i> should convey the following qualities and emotions:</p><ul>  <li>Integration</li>  <li>Seamlessness</li>  <li>Freedom</li>  <li>Liberation</li>  <li>Magic</li>  <li>Power without Effort</li>  <li> Structure and Support</li>  <li>Openness</li>  <li>Creativity and Politics</li>  <li>Discussion</li>  <li>Organic Growth</li></ul><p>These values are in contrast to the traditional World Wide Web. Existing web   sites focus on marketing, communicating a corporate message, and selling and   promoting products. There are some web sites that experiment with community.   Their approaches can be very powerful, but they suffer from fragmentation, proprietary   services, complexity, difficulty in setup, high-prices, or divergent user-interfaces. </p><p><i>Paper Airplane</i> does not take an antagonistic stance against the existing   World Wide Web (WWW); we are not trying to replace it. The WWW does many things   very good, such as presenting information, linking databases onto the Internet,   creating sophisticated server-side applications, and creating entertaining and   visually exciting web sites. <i>Paper Airplane</i> does many of these things   quite lousy, if at all, and is focused on other qualities, listed above.</p><p><i>Paper Airplane</i> is more an <i>evocative</i> than a <i>provacative</i>   vision. It predominantly states what it is <i>for</i> rather than what it is   <i>against</i>. However, it does take a stance against ICANN and Microsoft.   The stance towards ICANN is a strong one: ICANN should not exist and its actions   are illegitimate. The stance against Microsoft is not a strong one: fair competition   in browsers and word processors should exist. Microsoft deserves to exist just   as we deserve to exist, and innovation in empowering users with internet word   processors is encouraged.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align="right"><a href="UserManual.html">Table of Contents</a> | <a href="TargetAudience.html">Last</a>   | <a href="GoalsAndNonGoals.html">Next</a> </p></body></html>
