These are the non-goals of the version 1.0 release:<br></p><ul>  <li>Perfection<br>    <b>Why:</b> It's impossible.<br>    <b>Future:</b> We'll get perfect eventually. :)</li>  <li>Development for anything more than Microsoft Windows.<b><br>    Why:</b> We just don't have the resources at this time. 1.0 and the first     few point-releases will be Windows-specific.<br>    <b>Future:</b> Every technology we use is aggresively cross-platform. Porting     should not be hard; we just need the volunteers. The only problem will be     with the deep Windows integration for the <i>My Web Sites on the Two Way Web</i>     in <i>My Network Places</i>.</li>  <li>Instant Messaging<br>    <b>Why:</b> Too much for this release.<br>    <b>Future:</b> Extremely important.</li>  <li>Having Categories. Categories were a way to organize pages in a semi-hierarchical     manner. Other proposed names for this feature were Folders, Areas, and Search     Keywords.<br>    <b>Why:</b> It turns out that these are not really that useful for user's     during navigation. Dropping this feature turns out to simplify the user-interface     and make the system easier to understand.<br>    <b>Future:</b> None. Integrated Site Searching will take over as the primary     navigational aid in future versions of <i>Paper Airplane</i> instead of hierarchical     nesting. <br>  </li>  <li>What's Related functionality as a form of political commentary.<br>    <b>Why:</b> Too much for this release.<br>    <b>Future:</b> Extremely important. We need to do some more thought on this     as well.</li>  <li>Version control<br>    <b>Why:</b> Gobe doesn't include it.<br>    <b>Future:</b> Very important.</li>  <li>Discussion Areas on each page.<br>    <b>Why:</b> Too much for this release. Plus there are unresolved deep questions     about how notes, page-level discussions, discussion areas, What's Related.     and Gobe sheets overlap.<br>    <b>Future:</b> Extremely important. </li>  <li>Searching the full Two Way Web.<br>    <b>Why:</b> This is really really hard to do in a fast, reliable, completely     decentralized way. <br>    <b>Future:</b> This is a good goal for future versions.</li>  <li>Two Way Web Sites having integrated search engines and providing a standardized     way of searching.<br>    <b>Why:</b> It turned out that all of this was speced out, but at the last     hour it turns out I didn't completely understand the Mozilla search UI (it's     overly complex in my opinion). I don't have time to revisit the issue and     redo the UI mockups.<br>    <b>Future:</b> Very important, and will happen once we 'rationalize' Mozilla's     search UI.</li>  <li>Embedding form, field, or UI elements into pages.<br>    <b>Why:</b> There are significant unresolved UI questions for what a form     means when you have no centralized server. Who are you submitting this form     to? Where does it go? Is there a clear divisions between editing a template     and filling out a form (maybe not)? Further, adding these to the UI would     turn this program more into something like Hypercard, which isn't necessarily     bad but which deserves to have more thought on usability issues.<br>    <b>Future:</b> This is a good goal for future versions.</li>  <li>Templates and the Semantic Web. Templates were a way to automatically insert     metadata into a page as you created it, thus creating a base-line Semantic     Web. <br>    <b>Why: </b>Still alot of hard-issues to solve. Plus, we need to come up with     more &quot;pay-offs&quot; for what all this semantic information gives you     in the form of strong, user-level features. Cool technology needs to provide     strong user-benefit or it will fail.<br>    <b>Future: </b>Definite future but we need to do some more brainstorming.</li>  <li>Pages that are &quot;programmatic&quot;, i.e. server-side programs.<br>    <b>Why: </b>This is not a developer release, but rather an end-user release.     Developers are very important, but focus on <i>Paper Airplane</i> as <i>platform</i>     rather than <i>Paper Airplane </i>as <i>program</i> will have to wait for     the future. Plus, what does a server-side program look like in a peer-to-peer     web like the Two Way Web? There are some exciting ways that new peer to peer     services can be plugged into the network, but there are serious security issues     that need to be solved if this much flexibility is included.<br>    <b>Future: </b>Definite future but we need to do some more brainstorming,     especially about security.</li>  <li>SSL and electronic commerce for Two Way Web Sites. This will be included     for older World Wide Web sites, though.<br>    <b>Why:</b> This release is focused on non-commercial, creative, and political     uses. Further, what does SSL mean to a distributed web site? What does it     mean to pass your credit card number around between anonymous peers? Potentially     dangerous stuff outside our current target audience, so its not here until     these issues are solved. Empowering every user with the ability to host decentralized     electronic commerce could be very powerful and democratic in the future, though.<br>    <b>Future:</b> Might be part of a future release if issues can be resolved.     Maybe the credit card number never goes to the Two Way Web Site, for example,     but instead goes to a clearinghouse that authenticates both peers (the user     and the Two Way Web Site). Each client is given some kind of transaction ID.     These ideas should be explored in the future.</li>  <li>Inserting objects, OLE objects, plug-ins, and Java applets.<br>    <b>Why:</b> There are significant security concerns with OLE objects. We are     dropping plug-ins and Java applets to focus resources on other areas.<br>    <b>Future:</b> Plug-ins and Java applets will probably be supported first     in future versions. If security issues can't be solved for OLE objects (which     they might not), then they won't be supported.</li>  <li>Remote sites requesting more than username/public key from a user's personal     passport.<br>    <b>Why:</b> This is all that is needed for now.<br>    <b>Future:</b> A user's personal passport will expand to include all sorts     of personal information, stored under their control on their own personal     machine. Remote sites can request information, such as the user's credit card     number, and the user can decide whether to give this info to the remote site.   </li>  <li>Configurable user-interface, such as making your toolbar be small icons     or adding and removing individual icons.<br>    <b>Why:</b> This is chrome that we just don't have the time to support. Plus     it adds all sorts of nasty flexibility to the code that makes programming     hard.<br>    <b>Future:</b> This is important but not as important as other features, such     as instant messaging, templates, and the Semantic Web. Scheduled for future     releases.</li>  <li>Advanced control over how Mozilla stores its non-Two Way Web Site password     cache<br>    <b>Why:</b> Mozilla didn't think this UI through too well; it suffers from     featuritis when it should simply be invisible. Mozilla by default obfuscates     the password cache, giving the option of encrypting the cache instead. We     simply take the user's <i>Paper Airplane</i> password and use this to encrypt     the Mozilla password cache (if there are bugs with Mozilla's password encryption     system then obfuscation will be used instead).<br>    <b>Future:</b> No future; we do it in a way where option-itis isn't needed.</li>  <li>Bundling an email, calendering, or IRC program. Mozilla's XUL apps for these     will be dropped.<br>    <b>Why:</b> We can't bite off more than we can chew right now.<br>    <b>Future:</b> These will probably be included in <i>Paper Airplane</i> in     the future. Maybe not to avoid bloat, which is something <i>Paper Airplane</i>     needs to be careful of since it tries to be an integrative program. Maybe     we could have a <i>Paper Airplane Plus Pack </i>that installs all of these     extra applications if user's don't mind the bloat?</li>  <li>&#147;Shallow&#148; anonymity, which means you can sign into a Two Way Web     Site without using a public key, and &#147;Deep&#148; anonymity, which means     your IP address is hidden, requests for contents are proxied in a private     way, etc.<br>    <b>Why:</b> This is a major project in itself. Also, true anonymity imposes     heavy performance costs on the network and is too much to engineer this release.<br>    <b>Future:</b> &quot;Deep&quot; anonymity is a valuable goal that future contributors     can add. &quot;Shallow&quot; anonymity is very important and will be engineered     in soon, if it's possible.</li>  <li>Encrypted private communication.<br>    <b>Why:</b> Another major task that is not a goal of <i>Paper Airplane</i>     at this time. This feature would also impose large performance costs and add     another design point to an already difficult to design peer-to-peer network.<br>    <b>Future:</b> This will probably not be a major goal for the next few releases,     unless small amounts of information are being encrypted (such as commercial     transactions).</li>  <li>Digital signatures exposed to the user.<b><br>    Why:</b> There are UI and performance issues that need to be solved first.<br>    <b>Future:</b> This feature is important, and will be added in the future.</li>  <li>Mozilla Skins.<br>    <b>Why:</b> This is a non-core feature that is not important for this release.<br>    <b>Future:</b> This is an important feature for the future, possibly including     compatibility with Mozilla skins if possible.</li>  <li>Parodies. There used to be an option from the pull-down menus to instantly     create a parody of the site you were looking at. For example, you could easily     make a parody of the WTO web-site.<br>    <b>Why:</b> It turns out this is pretty hard to do for old HTML oriented sites.     We need to grab the whole site and provide controls for the user when they     are dealing with a huge site.<br>    <b>Future:</b> Not sure. Tools to help with parodies are considered important     though.</li>  <li>Any new technology, development, or function point not enumerated in this     document.<br>    <b>Why:</b> Features have to be pinned down, even if they aren't perfect.     Feature-creep is extremely dangerous.<br>    <b>Future:</b> If a promising new technology or function comes along that     is worthwhile, it should be written down so we can incorporate it into future     versions.</li>  <li>Massive collaborative filtering. This is a decentralized way to avoid abusing     the system, as well as keeping the noise level down and the signal level up.     For example, random user's would be asked to identify gibberish domain names,     and their responses would be automatically blended together to remove domain     names that are simply there to abuse the system.<br>    <b>Why:</b> This is a hard thing to finish both from a UI perspective and     an architectural one. Plus, I don't want to over-engineer moderation/filtering     until the core system itself isn't solid; it doesn't make sense to solve a     problem that isn't a problem yet. I want to see how the problem itself shapes     up first. I'll put out the fires once they start :)<br>    <b>Future:</b> Definently has a future.</li>  <li>Internationalization of the client user-interface.<br>    <b>Why:</b> Too much to bite off for now. However, it is an explicit goal     of this release to have a fully internationalized network, such that domain     names can be internationalized, file formats are internationalized, etc. However,     this internationalization will not be exposed to the user in this release     (i.e. you can't type in a Japanese domain name in the address bar yet, even     though the underlying network could store and find a Japanese domain name).<br>    <b>Future:</b> This is an extremely important feature for a soon after 1.0     release.</li>  <li>Military grade security.<br>    <b>Why:</b> Military grade security is simply impossible to do in a way that     ordinary users can interact with. For example, most user's get completely     confused by certificates, revoking certificates, granting certificates, etc.     that they simply decide not to use certificates at all. Another example is     email encryption; how many user's encrypt their email using PGP? Very few.     Faced with the choice of no security versus military grade security, <i>Paper     Airplane</i> takes a middle-ground approach: pragmatic security. Pragmatic     security means to have security that mirrors the risks of everyday life coupled     with balancing security needs against user-interface complexity. For example,     is it military grade security when we hand our credit cards to the clerk at     the grocery store? Or how about when we call on the phone and say we are someone,     and the party at the other end of the line only asks for our social security     number to authorize?<br>    <b>Future:</b> Specialized builds and forks will probably try to achieve this     level of security. It's something a third-party person would need to do though.</li>  <li>Renaming a Two Way Web Site or having more than one site name for a given     site<br>    <b>Why:</b> Not allowing this simplifies the network, makes security easier,     and prevents name hoarding.<br>    <b>Future:</b> Might have a future if it doesn't slow down the network and     if other ways of preventing name hoarding are found, such as only allowing     several name aliases per site.</li>  <li>Deleting a Two Way Web Site in one action<br>    <b>Why:</b> Not being able to do this significantly easily increases security.     Further, it allows us to drop the Administrator role. To delete a site simply     delete each of its pages. The site name will be sitting around, but one could     transfer this to a new group of Managers.<br>    <b>Future:</b> Probably none. Tools might be included to make transferring     a Two Way Web Site from one set of Managers to another set of Managers. These     tools might allow the Members themselves to vote for their new &#147;Managers&#148;     to ensure that they are not taken advantage of, though.</li>  <li>Deep control over how much bandwidth and storage the peer network can use<br>    <b>Why:</b> This is actually a pretty hard problem to solve, and is a good     candidate to reduce the size of the system for implementation.<br>    <b>Future:</b> Definite future. This is a very important feature that is needed     so that user's are in control of how much they contribute to the Two Way Web.</li>  <li>MagicNames, also known as Camel Case.<b><br>    Why:</b> After analyzing the user-interface, it was decided that explaining     how to format your page names as MagicNames is pretty difficult. Instead,     user's get all the benefits of MagicNames by surrounding any text they may     type with double-brackets, such as [[doing business in bangkok]]. The system     will AutoLink this and remove the brackets. This system gives all the benefits     of MagicNames without their funkiness and difficult to explain nature.<br>    <b>Future:</b> None.</li>  <li>Architecting the Two Way Web or <i>Paper Airplane</i> to take into account     limited configuration mobile devices.<b><br>    Why:</b> Limited configuration mobile devices have a range of special needs,     from small amounts of memory and storage space to limited processor speeds.     The Two Way Web uses algorithms, such as Forward Error Control (FEC), cryptographic     hashing algorithms, and hashcash, that are too intensive for tiny mobile devices.     Further, the Two Way Web expects every node to carry its weight rather than     be simply an observer, while a device such as a Palm Pilot is simply too underpowered     to act as a full member of the Two Way Web.<br>    <b>Future:</b> Not a design point for many releases, maybe never.</li>  <li>An XML file-format.<b><br>    Why:</b> This was going to be a feature of the first release, but after adopting     gobeProductive as the <i>Paper Airplane</i> editor we inherited its binary     format. <br>    <b>Future:</b> An extremely important goal that will happen when the gobeProductive     team is ready to move to XML.</li>  <li>Being able to use the Members Panel to find out info about a member (i.e.     pressing the Info button or right-clicking and selecting <i>Info</i> for a     username).<b><br>    Why:</b> Eventually the Members Panel will morph into a per-site buddy list     to perform single and group instant messaging with the members in real-time.     Not today, though. The Info functionality ties into this, since it is akin     to seeing someone's profile on AOL Instant Messenger. It also ties into templates,     semantic web, and other outstanding issues that are unresolved, but which     will hopefully One Day Be Solved (ODBS). There are also privacy issues and     creating a UI to choose your level of profile privacy.<br>    <b>Future:</b> Very important functionality that will come online once we     get the instant messaging functionality going. Might also be semantically     marked up if we resolve the template, semantic web, and privacy issues.</li>  <li>The following features from Mozilla are not in <i>Paper Airplane</i>: What's     Related, Internet Keywords, Searching from the Address Bar.<b><br>    Why:</b> Simplicity.<br>    <b>Future:</b> Might have a future once more important functionality is finished.     However, I do like the idea of features being dropped as successive versions     of a program come out, rather than feature bloat, as it is shown that most     users don't use them.</li>  <li>Being able to configure external editors for non-Two Way Web pages, such     as being able to associate Macromedia Dreamweaver (tm) with HTML pages so     that if the <b>Edit Page </b>button is pressed at an HTML page Dreamweaver     will be shown.<b><br>    Why:</b> Trying to drop features.<br>    <b>Future:</b> Has a definent future once the core is finished.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p align="right"><a href="UserManual.html">Table of Contents</a> | <a href="ValuesPhilosophyAndMarketing.html">Last</a>   | <a href="WhatYouNeedToRunPaperAirplane.html">Next</a> </p></body></html>
