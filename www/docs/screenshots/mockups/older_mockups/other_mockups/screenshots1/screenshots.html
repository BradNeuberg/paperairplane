<p>While Docuverse is both a non-commercial and non-profit project, we are currently 
  developing it &quot;under cover&quot;. This is for several reasons. One, we 
  do not want to announce Docuverse, gain a torrent of hype, and then having nothing 
  ready for two years. Users would end-up reading about Docuverse in an article, 
  and then come to a web-site that has nothing substantial. This is an issue which 
  has plagued the Freenet, Gnutella, and Mozilla projects, which announced their 
  existence before they had a substantial, working code base. It is better to 
  secretly develop Docuverse until it is ready to be released in beta form, and 
  then announce its existence. Further, Docuverse is possibly threatening to existing 
  entrenched interests in the computer field, and keeping it secret until it is 
  ready to be released gives these organizations less time to respond, kill off, 
  or clone Docuverse.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="5"><b><u>The Docuverse Manifesto</u></b></font></p>
<p>The web has become a stagnant play-thing of corporations and inaccessible international 
  organizations. Its original promise of bringing democratic, grassroots speech 
  from everyone to everyone has fallen by the way-side. Now is not the time to 
  give up, dismissing the web as an idealistic dream. Instead, we can dream into 
  existence a new evocative vision, a new web that rests on democratic principles. 
</p>
<p>Docuverse is a non-commercial, non-profit project to do just this. We are creating 
  a new space, named the Docuverse, which envelops the existing World Wide Web 
  and moves it forward in new innovative, democratic directions. We are replacing 
  and collapsing existing web browsers, web servers, web editors, and office productivity 
  suites into a single, unified new program named <b>Docuverse</b>. Since software 
  is also law, similar to how a building's architecture changes how people can 
  interact, Docuverse is also a <i>socialtecture</i>. In this new web socialtecture 
  everyone has a voice, regardless of wealth, power, or technical skill, and people 
  can collaborate to create spontaneous, organic spaces for politics, business, 
  and fun. It is easy to comment on the powerful, and the web becomes human-centered. 
  It is a profoundly democratic, decentralized vision.</p>
<p><b><font size="4">The 10 Dreams of Docuverse</font></b></p>
<p>The engine of Docuverse is a next-generation web site known as a <b>DocuBoard</b>. 
  At their most basic DocuBoards are simply super-charged web-sites that make 
  it possible to create, maintain, share, and discuss documents accessible only 
  to the people you want. Underlying DocuBoards, however, are ten dreams that 
  are the heart of the Docuverse:</p>
<p><b><font size="4">Dream 1: Freedom of Speech must include affordable access 
  to freedom of speech.</font></b></p>
<p>Imagine living in a kingdom that gave everyone the right to criticize the royalty 
  without fear of arrest or punishment. Also imagine, though, that in order to 
  open your mouth to make your criticisms you had to pay thousands or hundreds 
  of thousands of dollars. Would you say this society truly has freedom of speech?</p>
<p>This is the situation in most countries today that claim they have freedom 
  of speech. To reach thousands of people by radio, you have to purchase a hundred 
  thousand U.S. dollar radio license. To reach an entire community, you have to 
  own a million dollar newspaper printing press. Basically, the only way to communicate 
  is to become a business; sorry, a <i>rich</i> business.</p>
<p>The web was supposed to change this; the web was supposed to make it possible 
  to reach millions of people, even if you aren't a company. The reality is different. 
  One of the tragedies of the current World Wide Web is independent, non-commercial 
  web-sites being forced to commercialize in order to communicate with millions 
  of people. I call this the <b>Tragedy of the Dot Commons</b>. Imagine you are 
  a hobbyist poet who creates art after you come home from work; you share your 
  material with people on your web-site out of love, not out of money. At first 
  your web-site either doesn't cost anything or costs maybe ten dollars a month. 
  However, if you are successful, and people begin to flock to your web-site, 
  you could find yourself paying literally thousands of U.S. dollars a month for 
  powerful servers, hosting, and fast server connections. As an artist of course 
  you want to reach millions of people, so you change your .org to a .com and 
  attempt to become a business. Unfortunately, we've learned that the Internet 
  is not the best place to create businesses, so you go out of business, and your 
  art disappears from cyberspace. </p>
<p>Docuverse changes this. Instead of having a web site stored on a single centralized 
  server that takes money and technical knowledge to run, DocuBoards are broken 
  into pieces and redundantly stored across each of the member's and visitor's 
  personal computers. When a user types in a DocuBoard address into the Docuverse 
  program, Docuverse spontaneously re-assembles the DocuBoard and gives it to 
  the user transparently; now this user is himself free to hand out pieces of 
  the DocuBoard to those who request it. The upshot of this is that the more user's 
  who access a given DocuBoard, the more it is redundantly spread across member's 
  computers, and the better its performance and accessibility becomes. This type 
  of system is known as peer-to-peer, and is similar to the way in which music-sharing 
  programs like Napster, Gnutella, and AudoGalaxy work. The fundamental effect 
  of this is that no intervening corporation needs to be paid to run a server 
  or buy expensive server bandwidth from, allowing non-commercial sites to potentially 
  reach thousands of people without the Tragedy of the Dot Commons from occurring.</p>
<p><font size="4"><b>Dream 2: Web sites should be organic, grassroots, and bottom-up</b></font></p>
<p>Docuverse includes everything needed to create sophisticated, grassroots DocuBoards. 
  First, Docuverse includes wizards and templates to get you started creating 
  a diverse range of DocuBoards, from business oriented intranets, to personal 
  weblog diaries, to online political newspapers. Docuverse even includes editors 
  to create business-oriented documents, such as purchase orders, presentations, 
  spreadsheets, and drawings. Second, membership in your new DocuBoard can be 
  restricted to individual friends, family-members, or person's in your company, 
  or extended to the entire world. Finally, every page on your new DocuBoard can 
  be edited right through the Docuverse browser by pressing the Edit button if 
  the member has the necessary privileges. </p>
<p>Docuverse opens up a world of opportunities. For example, several people can 
  collaboratively create an online DocuBoard investigative journalism newspaper 
  and post articles all completely through the Docuverse browser. A company could 
  create a DocuBoard intranet, and let company employees create arbitrary DocuAreas 
  within this intranet, such as a company-wide accessible employee weblog, employee 
  created subprojects, or employee written newspapers, all without top-down authority. 
  This feature, coupled with the fact that DocuBoards are distributed across many 
  members computers and not stored on a server that suffers from scarcity, should 
  make many innovative, bottom-up collaborative web-sites possible.</p>
<p><font size="4"><b>Dream 3: The web should bloom with discussion</b></font></p>
<p>In the Docuverse browser is a single button, titled <b>Comments</b>, that holds 
  a great deal of power. Every web site and web page, including older World Wide 
  Web sites and DocuBoards, automatically have a discussion board attached, no 
  questions asked. For example, go to www.nike.com using Docuverse, click the 
  Comment button, and a pane pops open with a discussion area on it. Individual 
  pages also have discussion boards automatically attached as well, so readers 
  can comment on specific articles or pages.</p>
<p>Docuverse strikes a balance between the complete chaos of allowing everyone 
  in the world to comment on a given page and the complete control of only allowing 
  members to comment -- it gives everyone the best of both worlds. Users can choose 
  to view only comments posted by the members of that DocuBoard or can choose 
  to see non-members comments as well. </p>
<p>Docuverse also includes another important form of discussion; with a click 
  of a button <b>Parody</b> sites can be created. By selecting Parody from a pull-down 
  menu, the entire contents of a web-site will be copied and replicated into a 
  new parody DocuBoard. However, this web-site will prominently feature that it 
  is a parody and not the original, that you are unaffiliated with the original, 
  and pointers to the original site. You can then add members just like any DocuBoard, 
  and collaboratively create something new from the old. For example, you can 
  automatically parody the New York Times to create a comedic, artistic, or political 
  work, or maybe just create a juvenile piece of graffiti. As we all know, sometimes 
  the best art is generated from old art, even if American copyright law forgot 
  that.</p>
<p><font size="4"><b>Dream 4: It should be easy to find discussion commenting 
  on the powerful</b></font></p>
<p>Imagine another fantasy society, similar to the freedom of speech one, where 
  everyone has the right to criticize the powerful. However, imagine that those 
  criticisms have to be inscribed on a needle, and the needle is thrown into a 
  haystack. Voices affirming that society and the powerful, though, get to have 
  their messages written on giant billboards that can't fail to be seen. If you 
  can't easily or readily find dissenting voices in a society, does that civilization 
  really make it possible to comment on the powerful?</p>
<p>The current World Wide Web works the same way. The powerful own the radio stations 
  and the billboards lining our highways; it's easy for us to find their message. 
  What about the dissenters, Socratic voices on the edges? It's hard to find their 
  message, to investigate the alternatives, almost as difficult as finding a needle 
  in a haystack.</p>
<p>Docuverse changes this. Imagine being able to type www.nike.com.comment.labor 
  into your browser, and instantly finding out Nike's labor policy. Or how about 
  typing the address www.microsoft.com.comment.antitrust, and seeing comments 
  about Microsoft's antitrust record. Maybe you want to type www.greanpeace.org.comment.disagree 
  and see the perspective of those who offer flaws in the environmental movement? 
</p>
<p>Docuverse changes web site names in a new way. Every web site name can now 
  have a .comment ending attached to it, followed by a comment topic, such as 
  .environment, .religion, .agree, etc. There are about fifty predefined .comment 
  endings. After typing one of these after any domain name, such as www.whitehouse.gov.comment.money, 
  the Comment panel will open with all comments that have been posted by users 
  while viewing www.whitehouse.gov that concern money.</p>
<p>These .comment filters are auto generated by the users who post comments. When 
  a user posts a comment they can choose to assign it to one of the fifty pre-defined 
  categories, such as environment, religion, etc with a simple pull-down.</p>
<p>User's can also click the <b>What's Related</b> button to see what's related 
  to this web-site across all the different categories beyond the simple white-washed 
  recommendations Alexa makes.</p>
<p><font size="4"><b>Dream 5: Everyone should be able to communicate in complex 
  ways</b></font></p>
<p>Sure, nowadays anyone can create a simple home-page or a basic collection of 
  web pages. However, can they create an advanced intranet, a complex online newspaper, 
  or a rolling updated weblog diary? Not unless they either have strong technical 
  skills or the money to afford sophisticated server-side content management systems. 
  All of the tools above make it possible for ordinary, non-technical Average 
  Joes to create extremely powerful online communities with a few mouse-clicks.</p>
<p><font size="4"><b>Dream 6: Names are power - and no one should own that power</b></font></p>
<p>Domain names, such as www.acme.com or www.myschool.edu, are part of a semi-centralized 
  network known as the Domain Name System (DNS). DNS is currently controlled by 
  an unaccountable, undemocratic organization that has tended to kowtow to large 
  organizations and companies, and which has maintained and artificial scarcity 
  in domain names as bad as the radio spectrum. Docuverse banishes these bastards 
  (we did a study and decided they are no longer needed) by completely decentralizing 
  the DNS system in a peer-to-peer fashion in exactly the same way as DocuBoards 
  are broken into pieces amongst those who use the DocuBoards. Just as breaking 
  DocuBoards into pieces made it possible to create DocuBoards for free, breaking 
  the DNS system into pieces shared amongst those who use it make it possible 
  to use domain names for free. No longer will you have to pull out your credit 
  card, register a domain name in a difficult process, and wait a few days till 
  it activates. Instead, naming your DocuBoard becomes as easy and transparent 
  as naming a file on your local hard-drive; you don't even know it's an issue.</p>
<p>Domain names can also now have spaces in them, and Docuverse further explodes 
  the DNS name space with hundreds of new domain endings. The venerable .com, 
  .edu, and .org endings are now joined by .religion, .fan, .sucks, .cooperative, 
  .government, .religion.falun gong, .politics.conservative, .country.america, 
  and more. Your world isn't just about .COMpanies, .EDUcational institutions, 
  or .ORGanizations, so why should the web?</p>
<p><font size="4"><b>Dream 7: Web sites should have standardized user-interfaces 
  for navigation and provide more navigation tools</b></font></p>
<p>Application programs, such as Adobe Photoshop or Macromedia Dreamweaver, currently 
  have standardized user-interfaces. They all have pull-down menus, most have 
  toolbars, and most follow similar conventions. This allows new users to quickly 
  switch between different programs and quickly learn how to use them. Web sites, 
  though, have a confusing disarray of user-interfaces. Menus are in completely 
  different areas on different web-sites, if they exist at all. Some are on the 
  left, some are on top, some are in frames, and some are even fun nifty Java 
  applets! While novelty is the spice of life, having to learn a different user-interface 
  for every web-site is a pain.</p>
<p>Docuverse standardizes the navigation user-interface across all DocuBoards, 
  and introduces a substantial number of new ones. First, all DocuBoards now have 
  a navigator panel on the left of their screen that shows an outline of all pages 
  and areas on that web-site; user's can easily click around to quickly jump to 
  any page on the site. Second, all DocuBoards display a 'cookie trail' that communicates 
  to users how deep within a DocuBoard they currently are. Third, the standard 
  back and forward buttons in browsers gain two new friends: an Up button and 
  a Front button. The Up button takes you one step up in the hierarchy of the 
  DocuBoard, while the Front button will take you to the front page of that DocuBoard. 
  Fourth, all DocuBoards now include an Index button, which allows users to navigate 
  a DocuBoard in the same way they can turn to the index in the back of a book. 
  Fifth, all DocuBoards have a standard search field that is always in the same 
  place across all DocuBoards, so users can easily use Search to find information 
  on that DocuBoard. Sixth, all DocuBoards have a What's New button that will 
  show user's what has recently changed on that DocuBoard so user's can come up 
  to speed. And finally, all DocuBoards have a Members button so user's can easily 
  find out the members of a DocuBoard and communicate with them.</p>
<p>These features should make it significantly easier for users to do what they 
  do most on the web: find the information they are looking for, without having 
  to relearn how to do this at each web-site.</p>
<p><b><font size="4">Dream 8: Users should control their information</font></b></p>
<p>Industry players, from Sun to Microsoft, are currently bandying around ideas 
  to store your personal account information on centralized servers controlled 
  by them or other unaccountable organizations. While this will make it possible 
  to create single sign-on services for web-sites, it will be at the expense of 
  bolstering current monopolies, loss of privacy, and loss of control over your 
  personal information.</p>
<p>Docuverse makes single sign-on between DocuBoards possible without giving up 
  control of your personal information. Instead of storing your personal information 
  on some foreign server controlled by someone else, all your information is stored 
  on your local computer. When you attempt to access a DocuBoard, that DocuBoard 
  will ask your computer for the information it needs to log you in, such as your 
  username. A prompt will appear informing you that the foreign DocuBoard would 
  like this information. You can now choose to not allow the foreign web-site 
  to have this information; you are in control.</p>
<p>Credit card information works the same way. This will be stored on your own 
  machine, not on some foreign server. In Docuverse you will never have to type 
  this information in for a DocuBoard; however, if a DocuBoard wants this information, 
  the Docuverse browser will protect you and tell you that the DocuBoard wants 
  this information. Again, you can choose to deny this information. </p>
<p><font size="4"><b>Dream 9: The web should be smart enough to be a database</b></font></p>
<p>Docuverse includes two powerful features known as <b>Smart Sites</b> and <b>Smart 
  Templates</b>, which are an implementation of Tim Berner Lee's Semantic Web. 
  Docuverse comes bundled with a wide variety of pre-created areas for your DocuBoard 
  for commercial, political, non-commercial, and just plain fun communication. 
  One of the bonuses of having users create their DocuBoards through pre-created 
  templates is that the browser can now record exact metadata on what everything 
  actually is so that computers can understand the information. For example, when 
  you create an online newspaper area on your DocuBoard, Docuverse knows what 
  items on the board are newspaper articles, what are bylines, what are headlines, 
  etc. This information is used in powerful ways, such as in the automatic creation 
  of the site Index.</p>
<p>Smart Templates are similar to Smart Sites in that the Docuverse browser saves 
  information about every field with the document as metadata. Since Docuverse 
  comes bundled with a large number of page templates, such as Purchase Orders, 
  News Articles, To Do Lists, etc., what these fields mean can be standardized 
  across them. For example,<b> </b>Smart Templates always know what fields are 
  addresses or customer names, across every template. It knows that a particular 
  person authored a page, or that someone parodied a page. In this way knowledge 
  across the entire Docuverse is represented in the same way and can be accessed 
  by intelligent computers. We have turned the web into a giant intelligent database, 
  taking it to the next level.</p>
<p><font size="4"><b>Dream 10: Everything should be wrapped into one tool but 
  accessible by other tools</b></font></p>
<p>As you can see from the dreams above, Docuverse collapse what used to be many 
  different systems into a single program. Gone are web servers, stand-alone web 
  browsers, content management systems, web editors, DNS servers, authentication 
  servers, and office productivity suites. The Docuverse is more accessible because 
  ordinary users now don't need to learn a multiplicity of programs or configure 
  complicated servers.</p>
<p>Docuverse, though, is open to other developers creating tools that interoperate 
  with it, though. First, it is completely open-source, so other users can take 
  its code-base and graft on new additions. Further, DocuBoards are saved in an 
  open XML file-format, replacing HTML and proprietary Microsoft Word files, so 
  other's can modify their software to load and edit DocuBoard pages. For example, 
  Macromedia could modify Fireworks to load your Docuverse purchase order, or 
  Microsoft could add filters to Microsoft Office to load your Docuverse presentation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="5"><b><u>Docuverse Screenshots</u></b></font></p>
<p>This is a collection of screenshots from the Docuverse usability studies. Note 
  that these are not actual screenshots of a working program; instead, they were 
  drawn using Macromedia Fireworks, and put in front of users to 'simulate' using 
  the program. Many screenshots are not included here. Click on each thumbnail

        left, which makes it possible to easily jump to any area in the web site; 
        an <b>Index</b>, which makes it possible for users to find information 
        on the web site similar to an index in the back of a book; and a standardized 
        way to <b>Search</b> the information on a web site. In addition, a <b>Cookie

      <p><b>The Comments Area. </b>Every page in the Docuverse, including existing 
        World Wide Web pages, can now automatically have comments attached to 
        them. No one has to 'create' these discussion areas; they simply automatically 
        exist at every page and can be opened by pressing the Comments button. 
        These comments can be filtered by posts by members, by non-members, or 
        by everyone, and include a distributed moderation system similar to the 
        one on Slashdot. Posters can elect to assign their comments to particular 
        pre-defined categories, such as &quot;Agree&quot;, &quot;Disagree&quot;, 
        &quot;Politics&quot;, &quot;Labor&quot;, etc. These posts and categories 
        are culled and appear in the <b>What's Related</b> area that can be pulled 
        down, so that users can find comments on those who Agree with this site, 
        those who Disagree, etc. Further, users can add a special set of domain 
        names to the end of any World Wide Web or Docuverse site, such as www.nike.com.comment.labor, 
        and instantly see posts and related sites commenting on Nike's labor policy.</p>

      <p><b>The New DocuBoard Wizard. </b>Unlike earlier browsers, creating advanced

      <p><b>Editing mode.<i> </i></b>One of the breakthroughs in Docuverse is 
        that it makes the web editable again. If you have appropriate access to 
        a page on a DocuBoard, you can press the <b>Edit</b> button and start 
        editing that document. Docuverse includes editors for text documents, 
        presentations, spreadsheets, and drawings. Docuverse also significantly 
        simplifies doing word processing over the Microsoft Office model; instead 
        of having small, confusing icons to add tables, outlines, etc., Docuverse 
        includes large icons with text underneath, such as &quot;Insert Table&quot;, 
        and instantly makes all tools available as different tabbed icon toolbars 
        (&quot;Insert&quot;, &quot;Draw&quot;, etc.) Further, instead of wading 
        through endless tabbed dialogs to change how your selections in your document 
        are formatted, such as borders and text colors, Docuverse includes a floating 
        <b>Formatting</b> palette that makes all formatting properties instantly 
        accessible and changeable.</p>
      <p>In this screenshot we are beginning to edit a Purchase Order based on 
        a <b>Smart Template</b>. Smart Templates are similar to Smart Sites in 
        that the Docuverse browser saves information about every field with the 
        document as metadata. Since Docuverse comes bundled with a large number 
        of page templates, such as Purchase Orders, News Articles, Employee List, 
        etc., what these fields mean can be standardized across them. For example,<b> 
        </b>Smart Templates always know what fields are addresses, or which ones 
        are customer names, across every template. In this way knowledge across 
        the entire Docuverse is represented in the same way and can be accessed 
        by intelligent computers. We have turned the web into a giant intelligent 
        database. </p>

<p><b><u><font size="5">Supporting Technologies</font></u></b></p>
<p>Docuverse is an open-source project, and will be released under the GPL (GNU 
  Public License). If you are not familiar with what open-source means, it means 
  that users have the freedom to see the program's source code, modify it, and 
  distribute the program and modifications free to other users; users are also 
  protected from other users making proprietary, private modifications. In this 
  way the pool of openly available code constantly grows.</p>
<p>Docuverse heavily depends on other open-source projects in order to make it 
  a feasible system to build and maintain. The following projects will be used 
  in the code base:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b><a href="http://www.opneoffice.org">OpenOffice</a></b> - OpenOffice is 
    a full, cross-platform, open-source clone of Microsoft Office. It includes 
    a full word-processor, presentation, drawing, and spreadsheet package. It 
    is completely Microsoft Office-compatible, and saves files in an open, XML-based 
    file format that is well-documented. Docuverse will heavily rely on OpenOffice's 
    technical infrastructure and editors; in many ways Docuverse can be imagined 
    as a 'shell' that wraps OpenOffice. Docuverse will also rely on OpenOffice's 
    cross-platform component infrastructure named UNO, Universal Network Objects. 
    UNO allows full-featured Office-like applications to be written in C++, Java, 
    and a variety of scripting languages.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.jxta.org"><b>JXTA</b></a> - JXTA is an open-source, 
    peer-to-peer library written in Java. It abstracts away the difficulties of 
    the actual, underlying peer-to-peer protocol being used, making it possible 
    to optimize the Docuverse sharing algorithm in the future without changing 
    the Docuverse code base. Further, JXTA makes it easy to add new peer-to-peer 
    network services in the future.</li>
  <li><b><a href="http://www.jxta.org">JXTA Search</a> - </b>JXTA Search is a 
    peer-to-peer service for JXTA originally created by a startup company, purchased 
    by Sun, and released as open-source. JXTA Search includes a full, distributed, 
    meta-data based search service.</li>
  <li><b><a href="http://www.javasoft.com">Java</a> </b>- Much of Docuverse will 
    be coded in Java, in order to take advantage of Java's rapid development time 
    and extensive code libraries. Note however that Java's Swing and AWT packages 
    will not be used due to performance, memory, and functionality issues.</li>
  <li><b><a href="http://www.eclipse.org">SWT</a></b> - SWT, the Simple Widget 
    Toolkit, is an open-source GUI toolkit for Java written by IBM as part of 
    their Eclipse project. SWT is a very thin, cross-platform GUI toolkit that 
    has significant advantages over Java's Swing and AWT GUI toolkits. It has 
    extremely low memory usage, very good performance, fast startup times, and 
    adapts to the native theme set by the user.</li>
  <li><b><a href="http://www.mozilla.org">Mozilla</a></b> - Mozilla is a cross-platform, 
    open-source browser and browser engine that are extremely standards compliant. 
    Docuverse will use the browser engine to render pre-Docuverse web-pages. The 
    Mozilla browser engine does not suffer from the same performance and memory 
    issues that plague the Mozilla browser itself, since it does not include the 
    XML GUI infrastructure that the Mozilla 'chrome' is built from.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="5"><b><u>Docuverse Timeline</u></b></font></p>
<p>There is no exact timeline for release of Docuverse; it is estimated that the 
  full project will take a year and a half to complete. Docuverse is an unusual 
  open-source project in that the bulk of the time will actually be spent in usability 
  testing and honing the user-interface. In addition, Docuverse will try to find 
  talented graphic designers and advertisers to create a brand identity through 
  professional icon design, a logo, slogan, targeted message, etc. Here are the 
  stages of development: </p>
<ol>
  <li><b>Usability Testing</b> - Guerilla usability testing done with full mockups 
    of the user-interface. Full functionality of the application is also determined. 
    This phase will be finished the end of March 2002. Its deliverable will be 
    a Software Engineering Requirements Document that will be unusual; instead 
    of a traditional, technical Requirements Document it will be crafted as the 
    help documentation for the user of the application, complete with screenshots. 
    It will be tailored to fit the style of the existing OpenOffice help documentation.</li>
  <li><b>Docuverse Identity Package</b> - This task will be done by a third party 
    while usability and architectural work is occurring. The deliverable for this 
    is a new name for Docuverse and DocuBoards (these are temporary names), a 
    slogan, a logo, and a focused re-write of the Docuverse Manifesto/Overview 
    that is appropriate as the introduction screen when Docuverse is first started 
    up. This introduction screen should 'sell' the idea of Docuverse and explain 
    how it works from an end-user perspective so the user can get started.</li>
  <li><b>Graphic Design of User-Interface - </b>This task will be done by a third 
    party while usability and architectural work is occurring. The deliverable 
    for this is a unified look-and-feel and 'visual message' based on a color-scheme, 
    icons, layout and graphic design of the pages generated by the template wizards, 
    wizard graphics, and more.</li>
  <li><b>Security Analyses</b> - Identify the potential motivations to destroy 
    or incapacitate the Docuverse network, possible security issues in the existing 
    open-source code bases being used, and steps that should be taken to minimize 
    or erase these risks. This task will be done simultaneously with the Architecture 
    step. The deliverable for this is a Security Analysis paper.</li>
  <li><b>Architecture - </b>Create the actual blueprints and system architecture 
    for Docuverse. The deliverable for this will be a System Architecture document.</li>
  <li><b>Programming - </b>Actually create the Docuverse system. Outside volunteer 
    programmers will probably be privately approached to help build the system. 
    The deliverable for this step is a feature-complete beta-quality system, with 
    possibly some features dropped for future releases due to time-constraints 
    or complexity-issues. This release will be considered a 1.0 beta 1 release.</li>
  <li><b>Docuverse Web Site Creation</b> - Create the web-site that will be used 
    by developers and users to get and develop Docuverse once Docuverse is announced.</li>
  <li><b>Announcement and Beta Release</b> - Get outside advertising and public 
    advocacy-oriented individuals to volunteer and help determine the best way 
    to announce and promote Docuverse, and do an actual beta release. </li>
  <li><b>Bug Testing</b> - Build a bug-testing community and perform successive 
    releases of higher and higher quality. New functionality will not be accepted; 
    however minor usability changes can be made for the first few beta releases. 
    Each successive release will be called 1.0 beta 2, 1.0 beta 3, etc., until 
    1.0 Release Candidate 1 and 1.0 Release Candidate 2 are ready. The final release 
    of Docuverse will be called Docuverse 1.0.</li>
