Types of Index Entries
----------------------

*by type (List of Proposals, List of Purchase Orders, etc.)
*by what author has authored (comments, changes, and pages created)
*by special author things (about, contact, concerning)
*Redirects for members (about member, comments by member, contact member, changes by member, pages by member) - tells user to go to invidiual member name
*Redirects for comments (comments about) - shows all comment keywords; when keyword is clicked on, user is taken to another place with that keyword broken out
*by generic metadata (Dublin Core - by Date created, by date modified, by title, by subject, by author)
*by keyword fields (3 can be given)
*by the words in the title of a page or subject of a comment (stemmed and commons stripped, though)
*by special fields own special rules (purchased by, address, etc.) - Actually, not for this release.  This is pretty hard to define both on a UI level and during programming on a field by field type level. Next version! :)
*by the 'type' of comments (for, against, environment, brainstorm, etc.)



Important Notes
--------------

Individual Smart Templates will want to be able to control indexing information, especially affecting individual types of RDF info.  They will also want to over-ride the default name given to a new document of that type (ex: Status Report for Employee), and be able to autofill and change that name as the editing process continues (Status Report for Susan Kassin after Employee name filled out).

Certain special categories will need to be able to have control over how things are listed (they may not be alphabetically); this is true for viewing pages by date created, for example.

Add subject field to all templates, or maybe "Keywords" where you can only enter three kinds of keywords.

Screen keywords to make sure they don't repeat (i.e. someone uses the keyword 'proposal' when that already lists all proposals - could be hard).

The concerning field can say everyone or all; this will automatically put this entry under the 'concerning' part of each person.  Also, if anyone replies to a comment you made, then the Re:s will go under your concerning.

If an entry made by some special fields is clicked on (such as project name), then browser jumps right to that page AND right to that field, like an anchor.

If someone types "Ryan Blum" (or firstname lastname pair) into the Index find box, it should 'figure' this out after you have typed the whole name (this might be too hard, or too slow).
