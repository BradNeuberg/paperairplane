What if you were empowered to create collaborative web-sites without configuring servers, pulling out credit cards to buy domain names, or learning HTML?  What if web-sites became more interactive, where everyone could easily communicate, and less like silent straightjackets?  Paper Airplane is a non-commercial browser that makes these promises true by radically including everything necessary to author and view sites for free.  It fuses a web browser, a powerful word-processor, and a peer to peer web server together to create the Two Way Web.  Paper Airplane sledgehammers the Two Way Web Sites it creates, smashing them into hundreds of fragments that are securely stored across a multitude of machines in a process known as peer to peer, similar to Napster.  Choose from hundreds of new domain endings for your new site, such as .politics, .fan, .religion, .gay, or .environment.  Want to create a web-site named Nike.sucks, or maybe Enron.fraud? Go for it. Finally, Paper Airplane includes an advanced What You Create Is What Your Users See (WYCIWYUS) word processor that rivals Microsoft Word.
