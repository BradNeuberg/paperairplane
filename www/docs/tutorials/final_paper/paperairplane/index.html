 style="font-size: 20pt;"><b><a name="intro">Introduction</a></b></font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style=""><span
 style="font-style: normal;"><font size="3">What
if community and editing were a central and transparent part of the
web and browsers</font></span></span>? </p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style=""><span
 style="font-style: normal;"><font size="3">What
if the web was extremely integrated for usability, with instant
messaging, site creation, the web server, and more all integrated
into one whole</font></span></span>? </p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal;">
<font size="3">What would this web look like if despite being
integrated it was massively decentralized on a peer-to-peer network,
able to exist and run without businesses or governments?</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style=""><span
 style="font-style: normal;"><font size="3">The
answer is a web where people, collaboration, and usability are first
class citizens. This paper is a thought experiment launched from
these questions, a vision of</font></span></span> how the web will be
drastically different when it supports seamless community as a
major component of the browser. The goal is to expand and consider
ideas and technologies that push the boundary of what is technically
possible. Engineering constraints and pragmatism are extremely
important but can sometimes limit designers from imagining new ways of
structuring software.&nbsp; Rather than focus on the technical <span
 style="font-style: italic;">how</span> this paper focuses on the <span
 style="font-style: italic;">what </span>in order to stimulate thought
beyond
current engineering capabilities, providing future possibilities that
research and coding efforts can steer toward.&nbsp; <br>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">This paper describes a new web browser,
named Paper Airplane, and a new World Wide Web, called The Two Way
Web. This new system has two components: native support for
collaboration and massive decentralization of the new web's technical
plumbing. </p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Paper Airplane and the Two Way Web are
an extension of WikiWiki's, special web sites in which anyone can add
and edit content within the browser. Paper Airplane generalizes
Wikis across the entire web, bringing them into the browser and
transforming what the web could be. Why can't the browser natively
support powerful editing, collaboration, and messaging tools so that
every web site can choose to be as transparent and grassroots as
traditional Wikis are? Further, the browser itself becomes a
platform for hosting this new web; every web browser is also a web
server
that collaborates with other browsers in a peer-to-peer network,
creating a rich system of nodes that provides decentralized and
transparent services such as storage, search, naming, and more.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Paper Airplane and the Two Way Web do
not exist; they are a series of user-interface mockups and a vision
for what a new version of the web could look like. This paper
explains the vision by presenting the major portions of this new
network and providing a UI walkthrough.<br>
<br>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; text-align: left;"><font
 size="5" style="font-size: 20pt;"><b><a name="prior_work">Prior
Work</a></b></font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Unifying editing and community into the
browser is not new; it is an integral piece of Tim Berners Lee's
vision for the web. The first web browser, <span
 style="font-style: normal;">WorldWideWeb
for the NeXT machine, included an editor and annotation tools. Other
prior work on editing and the web includes Ward Cunningham's
WikiWiki; the Netscape Communicator suite of tools, which included an
editor, email client, news client, and browser; and Dave Winer's
work with Edit this Page, Manila, and XML-RPC. The blogging
community has also been exploring similar ideas in the context of
blogging. </span>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="font-style: normal;">Collaborative
hypertext is also not new; Douglas Englebart included it in his </span>NLS<span
 style="font-style: normal;"><span style="font-style: italic;">
</span>presentation and system, while Ted Nelson describes a vision for
a
collaborative web of documents and editing in his </span>Xanadu<span
 style="font-style: normal;">
vision. </span>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Work has also
occurred on turning a P2P network of nodes into a decentralized
storage system for ease of publishing; some example systems are
MojoNation, MNet, and FreeNet. The history of
unified collaboration tools is also long, including such software as
Lotus Notes and
Groove.<br>
<br>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; text-align: left;"><font size="5"
 style="font-size: 20pt;"><b><a name="overview">Paper
Airplane &amp; The Two Way Web</a></b></font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">The vision of Paper Airplane and the
Two Way Web is composed of the following major pieces: Instant Site
Creation, the P2P Mesh, the Editor, Instant Messaging, the Smart
Browser, and the Two Way Web Directory. </p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">First is a web browser that supports
<b>Instant Site Creation</b> by including everything
necessary to create and serve web sites; there is no separation 
between browser and server. Every browser is automatically a server
and can handle requests for web sites, and includes wizards for
creating sites. The Instant Site Creation tools also support the
full spectrum of public and private, allowing everything from
completely private work groups to completely editable public sites.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Once the site is set up and users are
viewing pages, they can use <span style="font-weight: bold;">The Editor</span>
to create and edit pages.<b><span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span></b>The
Editor<span style="">
is a full-featured word processor built into the browser, an
Internet-focused light office suite. Unlike existing packages such as
Microsoft Word, this new editor is focused on
web-based collaboration rather than printing pretty documents. Further,
this Internet-centric editor has one click editing and
saving; no more FTP or uploading files. Editing and saving documents
is now similar to WikiWikis, but far more powerful and brought into
the browser.</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><b>Instant
Messaging</b> is integrated into every web site, including the
editor. Every web site now supports instant messaging, so that as
you browse a site you can communicate with that site's members. You
can edit documents in the editor while communicating with others who
are also editing that document, collaboratively creating a page using
synchronous edit tools.
Further, instant messaging for a site hooks into how public or
private you decide to make your web community during the Instant
Site Creation process, empowering site creators to choose how they want
instant messaging to work.<br>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><b>The Smart Browser</b><span style="">
is a new concept for the browser's relationship with a site. The
browser now includes many things that used to be on the server,
standardizing and making many common tasks much simpler across the
web. For example, the browser includes single sign-on, so that users
can sign into the browser itself on startup and then authenticate
against other sites automatically. The Smart Browser vision also
includes many tools for working with and viewing web sites in much
more sophisticated ways, including searching, tagging pages, viewing
pages by tags, tracking site changes, automatic indexing, and more.</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><b>The Two Way Web
Directory</b><span style=""> is a Yahoo-like portal
that is decentralized and which makes it easy for users to find and
search the Two Way Web. During site creation using the Instant Site
Creation tools inside the browser, users can choose up to three tags
to describe their site, such as <i>Politics </i><span
 style="font-style: normal;">and </span><i>Campaign Finance Reform</i><span
 style="font-style: normal;">,
for example. This information is stored in the P2P Mesh in such a
way that a Yahoo-like index can be shown to end-users in the browser,
generated from all of the tags.&nbsp; This directory also supports
Google-style searching.&nbsp; No one company or entity controls this
virtual Yahoo; it appears to the end-user as a centralized, easy to
use website but is in fact a fantasy, a creation put together
by the Paper Airplane browser while communicating in the P2P Mesh.</span></span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal;">The browser hooks
into a
peer-to-peer network of all other Paper Airplane browsers that are
running named the <b>P2P Mesh</b>. The Two Way Web is actually a
virtual illusion created from all running Paper Airplane browsers, a
co-creation of many browsers autonomously creating a P2P Mesh. These
browsers work cooperatively to do routing, distributed naming,
automatic provisioning of storage and replication, etc. When a user
wants to create or save a website using the Paper Airplane browser,
they do
not have to worry about storage or uploading files; Paper Airplane
works with the cooperative P2P Mesh to
automatically get the user started without having to know how to set
up a web server, save files, or configure DNS.<br>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal;">
<font size="3">This walkthrough describes the five major pieces of
Paper Airplane: Instant Site Creation, The Editor, Instant Messaging,
The Smart Browser, and the Two Way Web Directory.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal;"><br>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; text-align: left;"><font
 size="5"><b><a name="instant_site_creation">Instant
Site Creation</a></b></font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal;">
<font size="3">At first glance Paper Airplane looks like a normal
browser, but with one extra piece, a special toolbar that is the
jumping off point for accessing an extensive suite of tools for the
creation of advanced online communities, collaboration, and editing:</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; text-align: center;">
<font size="3"><img style="width: 1024px; height: 768px;"
 alt="View Mode" src="images/viewmode.png"><br>
</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal;">
<font size="3">The first major step in empowering users to collaborate
is to make it drop dead simple to create online web sites. To do
this, users simply click on the New Site Button in the Edit toolbar:<br>
</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; text-align: center;">
<font size="3"><img style="width: 1015px; height: 44px;"
 alt="View Mode - Edit Toolbar" src="images/viewmode_edit_toolbar.png"><br>
</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal;">
<font size="3">Clicking the New Site Button leads a user to the New
Site Wizard. This wizard guides users through everything necessary
to create advanced online collaborative web sites. In several simple
steps a user can choose a domain name and ending from an expanded,
new domain name system called DisDNS; enter tags that will be used to
autocategorize their site later in the Two Way Web Directory; and
choose how public or private they would like to make their site. </font>
</p>
<p style="font-style: normal;"><font size="3">You
may be familiar with domain endings from the older World Wide Web,
such as .com and .org. This system is fraught with problems: it is
beauracratic; the endings that are available are tightly restricted;
creating and registering domain names is expensive and
time-consuming; and the system itself is controlled by an
un-accountable international organization. <i>Paper Airplane</i>
leaves this system in place for older web sites, but replaces it for
the new Two Way Web.</font></p>
<p>This new domain name system, known as the Distributed Domain Name
System (DisDNS), brings a host of new, easy to use capabilities to
users. First, it now includes hundreds of endings, such as .love,
.environment, .politics, and more. For example, users can create Two
Way Web Sites such as <i>www.nike.laborpolicy </i><span
 style="font-style: normal;">and
</span><span style="text-decoration: none;"><i>www.microsoft.antitrust</i><span
 style="font-style: normal;">,
or could s</span></span>hare their online poetry community with the
world at <i>www.poetry.community. </i>Users can type these new
domain endings right into the <span style="font-style: normal;">Paper
Airplan</span>e<i> </i>browser to reach their Two Way Web Sites, just
like normal sites. Users are guided in choosing a domain name and
ending in the New Site Wizard:</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; text-align: center;">
<font size="3"><img style="width: 608px; height: 475px;"
 alt="New Site Wizard - Choose Name"
 src="images/new_site_wizard_choose_name.png"><br>
</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal;">
<font size="3">This step of the wizard even makes it possible for users
to create entirely new Top Level Domain endings!</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal;">
<font size="3">Once a domain name is chosen, a user then chooses
several tags for categorizing their site. These tags are totally up
to the user and will be used later to create a spontaneous folksonomy
directory of new Two Way Web Sites that other individuals can use to
find sites that match their interests:<br>
<br>
</font></p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<font size="3"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><img
 style="width: 608px; height: 475px;"
 alt="New Site Wizard - Choose Tags"
 src="images/new_site_wizard_choose_tags.png"></span></font><br>
<font size="3"><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></font></div>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal;"><font size="3">The
New Site Wizard also allows a user to select how
public or private they would like to make a web site. Collaboration
should support many different modalities of public and private, from
completly open and anarchistic Wiki-like sites to absolutely closed
private Intranet-style sites. </font>
</p>
<p style="font-style: normal;"><font size="3">Paper
Airplane achieves this by defining several simple roles that users
can have and how users are given these roles. Two Way Web Sites
have three roles: <i>Managers</i>, <i>Members</i>, and <i>Non-Members</i>.
<i>Managers</i> can add and remove people, and can edit and delete
pages, while <i>Members</i> can create and edit pages, but can not
delete them or manage other members. What <i>Non-Members</i> can and
can't do depend on how open or closed you decide to make your site.</font></p>
<p style="font-style: normal;"><font size="3">The
New Site Wizard allows site creators to define how members are given
roles and how much power non-members have in the site:</font></p>
<p style="font-style: normal; text-align: center;"><font size="3"><img
 style="width: 608px; height: 475px;"
 alt="New Site Wizard - Choose Policy"
 src="images/new_site_wizard_choose_policy.png"><br>
</font></p>
<p style="font-style: normal;"><font size="3">Four
different kinds of sites are possible using this wizard:</font></p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p style="font-style: normal;"><font size="3"><b>Super Public</b>,
which is basicly akin to a completely open, Wiki-like site where
everyone is automatically a <i>Manager</i> and can therefore do
anything they like to the site</font></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="font-style: normal;"><font size="3"><b>Public Sites</b>,
where anyone can become a <i>Manager</i> after registering; this is
almost as open as Super Public but creates a small amount of friction.</font></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="font-style: normal;"><font size="3"><b>Public Restricted</b>,
where anyone can view the site but existing <i>Managers</i> must
approve their joining in order for them to become <i>Managers</i> and <i>Members</i>
themselves.</font></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="font-style: normal;"><font size="3"><b>Private Sites</b>,
in which no one can even view the site, much less edit it, unless they
were pre-invited by existing <i>Managers</i>.</font></p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p style="font-style: normal;"><font size="3">When
a user is finished with this Wizard, the Paper Airplane browser
creates the Two Way Web Site on the user's local machine and in the
P2P Mesh and registers the new domain name in the DisDNS system. Users
do not have to find a server provider, storage, or fish out
their credit cards to pay and register a domain name, since the peer
network itself resolves and finds domain names (more on this in the
section titled P2P Mesh). </font>
</p>
<p style="font-style: normal;"><font size="3">Finally,
the user is presented with the first, new, unedited page of their Two
Way Web Site that provides getting started options:</font></p>
<p style="font-style: normal; text-align: center;"><font size="3"><img
 style="width: 1024px; height: 768px;" alt="Newly Created Site"
 src="images/newly_created_site.png"><br>
</font></p>
<p style="font-style: normal;"><font size="3">At
this point, a user can now engage The Editor to start editing and
creating their site.</font></p>
<p style="font-style: normal;"><br>
</p>
<p style="font-style: normal; text-align: left;"><font size="5"><b><a name="editor">The
Editor</a></b></font></p>
<p style="font-style: normal;"><font size="3">Every
web page you visit in a Two Way Web Site can be edited by pressing
the <b>Edit Page</b> icon, if the site is public or if you are a
member:</font></p>
<p style="font-style: normal; text-align: center;"><font size="3"><img
 style="width: 1015px; height: 44px;" alt="View Mode - Edit Toolbar"
 src="images/viewmode_edit_toolbar.png"><br>
</font></p>
<p style="font-style: normal;"><font size="3">Once
pressed, the browser shifts into an editor, where this page can be
edited in place without shifting into a different program or spawning
a new window:</font></p>
<p style="font-style: normal; text-align: center;"><font size="3"><img
 style="width: 1024px; height: 768px;" alt="Edit Mode"
 src="images/editmode.png"><br>
</font></p>
<p style="font-style: normal;"><font size="3">This
editor is a full featured office suite that is focused on creating
collaborative web pages rather than printing pretty documents, as
existing office suites like Microsoft Word are. First, the editor is
WYSIWYG, so creating and editing pages is easy for mainstream users.
Second, saving a page is as easy as pressing the Save Page button in
the toolbar:</font></p>
<p style="font-style: normal; text-align: center;"><font size="3"><img
 style="width: 43px; height: 44px;" alt="Save Button"
 src="images/save_button.png"><br>
</font></p>
<p style="font-style: normal;"><font size="3">Pressing
this button causes the page to transparently save into the remote web
site; the user does not have to hassle with uploading any files, FTP,
etc. The browser itself determines the best way to save the page,
such as into the P2P Mesh.</font></p>
<p style="font-style: normal;"><font size="3">Just
as Macromedia Fireworks is a hybrid editor, which combines vector and
bitmap editing in one application, the Paper Airplane Editor is a
hybrid editor, merging together both standard "typewriter"
editors such as Microsoft Word and page layout editors such as Adobe
Layout. Users can access the toolbar at the top of the browser to drop
text
boxes, images, and tables into a document, and then manipulate them
like a traditional word processing application such as Microsoft
Word.&nbsp; They can also work with items in the page as objects using
the Select button and move them around arbitrarily, like a page layout
application:<br>
</font></p>
<p style="font-style: normal; text-align: center;"><font size="3"><img
 style="width: 42px; height: 44px;" alt="Select Button"
 src="images/select_button.png"><br>
</font></p>
<p style="font-style: normal; text-align: left;"><font size="3">When
the page is first displayed the cursor is placed at
the upper left corner of the editing document, like a typewriter;
beginning users can simply start typing and using the editor in more
traditional ways. The power of this approach is that new users can
get started quickly, while power users can quickly jump back and
forth between the two modalities, using word processor and page
layout semantics where each makes sense.</font></p>
<p style="font-style: normal;"><font size="3">As a
user adds items to their document, such as text blocks or images, the
left-hand sidebar updates showing what can be changed to format this
object,
such as fonts, colors, borders, etc. This means that users no longer
have to search through endless dialog boxes to figure out common
formatting operations; everything is immediately accessible and
changeable to the user, again much more like Macromedia Fireworks
than traditional word processing applications. The UI becomes much
more flat, with the tools and properties that are necessary to get
any job done always present, leading to much faster productivity and
usability:<br>
</font></p>
<p style="font-style: normal; text-align: center;"><font size="3"><img
 style="width: 201px; height: 600px;" alt="Edit Mode - Sidebar"
 src="images/editmode_sidebar.png"><br>
</font></p>
<p style="font-style: normal;"><font size="3">Using
the editing toolbar, users also have access to an extensive suite of
tools. Notes can be dropped into a document; notes are like
mini-forums, and can record specific questions about content in a web
page.&nbsp; Notes can be edited and replied to without shifting into
the full edit mode to support lighter weight collaboration than full
page editing:<br>
</font></p>
<p style="font-style: normal; text-align: center;"><font size="3"><img
 style="width: 1024px; height: 768px;" alt="Comment in View Mode"
 src="images/comment.png"><br>
</font></p>
<p style="font-style: normal;"><font size="3">Users
can reply and jump through all of the notes in a page.</font></p>
<p style="font-style: normal;"><font size="3">The
Draw, Quickshapes, and Symbols buttons drop down to show common tools
needed for
diagramming and brainstorming, such as lines, diamonds, etc. so that
these symbols can
be placed into a document for discussion, ala Visio, but without having
to leave the browser:<br>
</font></p>
<p style="font-style: normal; text-align: center;"><img
 style="width: 174px; height: 43px;" alt="Diagram Buttons"
 src="images/diagram_buttons.png"><br>
</p>
<p style="font-style: normal;"><font size="3">The Signature button
allows a user to
select either the entire page or a portion of it to digitally sign
it, drawing on the user's authentication information that is needed
for single sign on, as described in the section The Smart Browser:<br>
</font></p>
<p style="font-style: normal; text-align: center;"><img
 style="width: 58px; height: 44px;" alt="Signature Button"
 src="images/signature_button.png"><br>
</p>
<p style="font-style: normal;"><font size="3">This makes it possible
for users to assert that particular portions
of a document or the entire page was created by them. The selected
portion is digitally signed and saved transparently with the page, and
the browser displays whether the signature is valid
automatically while others are viewing a page. <br>
</font></p>
<p style="font-style: normal;"><font size="3">The Editor also comes
with common
templates, such as ones for resumes, business letters, etc., but
these templates are special: they are Smart Templates. These
templates look just like common Microsoft Office templates, with
fields to guide the user in entering common information such as their
name, job position sought, etc. while editing and creating a
document. However, when a page is edited with a Smart Template we
record the semantic information of each field when we save the web
page. For example, if we are dealing with a resume template, with
fields for the person's name, work experience, etc. as the user fills
this information out we are recording what <i>type</i> of information
this is, which is then saved as a simple XML overlay with the HTML,
similar
to Microsoft's InfoPath application. The Two Way Web then becomes
not only a collaborative and P2P web, but it is also a semantic one in
that many of the pages will have enough bootstrap
information to create custom search engines and aggregators to find
specific kinds of
content, such as resume search engines. The Editor also includes
tools for users to create their own Smart Templates.&nbsp; <br>
</font></p>
<p style="font-style: normal;"><font size="3">A smart template for a
purchase order.&nbsp; <br>
</font></p>
<p style="font-style: normal; text-align: center;"><font size="3"><img
 style="width: 1024px; height: 768px;" alt="Smart Template"
 src="images/smart_template.png"><br>
</font></p>
<p style="font-style: normal;"><font size="3">Notice that this smart
template includes two kinds of
fields; the light blue fields are those that can be changed by the
editing user and which record semantic information when saved, while
the light gray fields are autocalculated by the smart template itself,
such as a total price for this purchase order or a date field.</font></p>
<p style="font-style: normal;"><font size="3">Just
like a Wiki the editor also includes autolinking. Every page you
create has a title:</font></p>
<p style="font-style: normal; text-align: center;"><font size="3"><img
 style="width: 803px; height: 28px;" alt="Cookie Trail"
 src="images/cookietrail.png"><br>
</font></p>
<p style="font-style: normal;"><font size="3">This
title is unique to each page and can be changed during page editing.
While editing a page, if you enter the special characters [[ around
any title, followed by a page name, then ]] again, the editor will
automatically hyperlink that text to a page with that name or add a
"Create" button at the end if it does not exist yet.&nbsp; <br>
</font></p>
<p style="font-style: normal;"><font size="3">The Paper Airplane
browser and editor also support tabs, similar to FireFox.&nbsp; The
browser can have several tabs open showing different web sites and
pages, with some of them being in edit mode.&nbsp; The user can jump
between tabs to quickly compile information while editing, for example,
or can be co-editing several pages at once either alone or with others
(see the Instant Messaging section for details on real-time
collaborative editing).&nbsp; Autolinking and the tabs work seamlessly
together as well.&nbsp; As page names are autolinked in the editor
while you are typing, the user can choose to open the auto-linked page
into a new browser tab to browse this new page or begin editing it as
well.&nbsp; This combination of tags and autolinking </font><font
 size="3">make working in the editor feel very
stream of consciousness and organic.<br>
</font></p>
<p style="font-style: normal;"><font size="3">The Editor also brings to
Wikis something long missing: autosave. At
regular intervals the editor saves the user's contents as drafts that
can be later retrieved if the browser crashes or the user
accidentally navigates away. Never lose your creative work again.</font></p>
<p style="font-style: normal;"><font size="3">When
a page is saved or created, it is stored into the P2P Mesh..</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal;">

P2P Mesh</a></b></font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal;">
<font size="3">Paper Airplane uses a P2P Mesh to achieve much of its
functionality in a transparent manner so end users do not have to
struggle with common administrative tasks. Peer-to-peer means that
ordinary end-users machines are used to co-create the network. Napster
did this with sharing music files, while Skype does it with
finding and routing Internet voice telephone calls using normal
end-user machines. The upshot is that very affordable networks can be
created in a decentralized, automatic manner.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal;">
<font size="3">Paper Airplane uses a P2P Mesh to achieve the following
functions: routing around network blockages, such as NATs and
firewalls; a domain name system named DisDNS for storing DNS names
and resolving them; a presence and communication fabric for instant
messaging; and virtualized storage using available P2P nodes for
saving and replicating web sites. The nodes in this P2P network are the
Paper
Airplane browsers themselves.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal;">

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; text-align: left;"><font

Messaging</a></b></font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal;">
<font size="3">As users are browsing a site, they will see other users
that are also members of this site in their sidebar.&nbsp; This IM
client is a simple, AOL Instant Messenger type
client where users can communicate one-on-one or form simple group
conferences to communicate as they browse the site.&nbsp;&nbsp; </font><font
 size="3">The IM sidebar respects the type of site it is attached to,
such as whether it is Super-Public or Private.&nbsp; If a site is
Super-Public then everyone on the site&nbsp; is shown, while a Private
site reveals private members only.&nbsp; A Restricted Public site would
only show those who have joined the site, reducing presence clutter in
the sidebar and allowing members to focus on each other to work
productively.<br>
</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal;">
<font size="3">While editing a document, if another user would also
like to edit this document a popup will appear saying that another
user is requesting to edit this document. If you agree, the editor
changes into a collaborative editor, with the IM client located in the
sidebar along with
the same formatting palletes that were discussed in the section The
Editor. Every user is assigned a color, and as you edit, add, and
remove content and objects the background color of these sections is
different, similar to SubEthaEdit. Every user also gets a
differently colored cursor so they can see what the other is editing.
<br>
</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal;"><font size="3">The
combination of shared editing with real time communication is
extremely powerful, especially since the tools for single and
collaborative editing are almost identical.&nbsp; The end result is
that users can do private and communal editing without learning a new
skill set.<br>

Smart Browser</a></b></font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal;">
<font size="3">Tools for navigation in browsers progressed rapidly in
the early days of the web, until they finally froze at their current
state in about 1995 and have remained relatively unchanged. This is sad
as the brower could standardize and embed
many tools for much more sophisticated ways of dealing with web
site</font><font size="3">s</font><font size="3">, especially around
collaboration.&nbsp; It's time for innovation.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal;">
<font size="3">Paper Airplane takes this to the next level with the
concept of the Smart Brower, where the browser embeds standard
navigation controls across the Two Way Web Sites it creates. This
section discusses how the Smart Browser makes end-user's lives easier.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal;">
<font size="3">First, Paper Airplane embeds single signon. When a
user first starts Paper Airplane they authenticate themselves against
the browser, using a signon dialog to unlock a public/private
keypair that is stored on the local machine. This public/private
keypair is linked to a handle, similar to an AOL screen name, that is
globally unique.&nbsp; It does not establish that they are a specific
person but rather that they have a particular handle.&nbsp; Then, as
they navigate
to each Two Way Web Site, the browser authenticates them in the
background using these keypairs against the remote site.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal;">
<font size="3">Single signon goes hand in hand with a standard way to
join and unjoin Two Way Web Sites. At any site, if the site creator
made it open, a user can press the Join button to become a member of
this site:</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; text-align: center;">
<font size="3"><img style="width: 1015px; height: 44px;"
 alt="View Mode - Edit Toolbar"
 src="images/viewmode_edit_toolbar.png"></font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal;">
<font size="3">When this is pressed, in the background the browser
sends the user's public key to the remote site to be used later for
single sign on activities, editing, and site roles. </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal;">
<font size="3">The next standardized interface in the smart browser is
a standard way to track site changes, which is a panel that appears
in the left-hand sidebar when selected:</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal;">
<font size="3"><img style="width: 1024px; height: 768px;"
 alt="New Changes Sidebar" src="images/new_changes.png"><br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
</span>This panel is created by using an RSS stream from the
remote site, and can track recent site edits using the Paper Airplane
Editor, or if the remote site is a blog recent updates to a blog or
corporate site, for example. When users go to a new site they won't
have to wonder what has changed; the Recent Changes panel makes it
easy for them.<br>
</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal;"><font size="3">Members
of sites can also easily manage roles with the Members sidebar:<br>
</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; text-align: center;"><font
 size="3"><img style="width: 1024px; height: 768px;"
 alt="Members Sidebar" src="images/members.png"><br>
</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal;">
<font size="3">Every page also has a control so that users can tag it
with a given topic, such as "important", &#8220;todo", or
&#8220;linux&#8221;, for example:<br>
</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; text-align: center;"><font
 size="3"><img style="width: 803px; height: 28px;" alt="Cookie Trail"
 src="images/cookietrail.png"><br>
</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal;"><font size="3">Then,
by pressing the Navigator section in the
sidebar they can view all of the pages in a web site sorted by
Tag, by Name, and more. This Navigator makes it possible for users
to quickly jump to new adhoc categories created by other users,
sorted into bottom-up categories using the tagging control. The
Navigator also includes other powerful ways to view a web site:
Recently Edited, which shows recently edited pages; and My Recent
Pages, which shows your own recently edited or viewed pages so that
you can quickly jump back to them.&nbsp; The end result is that
structure is brought to collaborative sites in a bottom-up, organic
manner rather than through top-down controls that quickly become out of
date. </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal;">
<font size="3">The Navigator also exposes a sorting type called By
Index, which takes a bit of explaining but which is very powerful. As
pages are created and edited, an automatic index is created in the
background. When a user views a site in the Navigator By Index, they
will see an automatic index similar to the index in the back of a
book or the one in Microsoft Help defining all the words, topics, and
relations gleaned from the site itself. Most importantly, if your
site members have used Smart Templates to create pages that have
simple semantic information in them, then we now have higher-level
metadata to hook our index on to. The index can be an extremely
powerful way for users to look into "the back of the book"
in a sense and jump right to the page and section they need to read or
edit.
Having an index to view a site is one of the payoffs for using Smart
Templates when editing and creating your collaborative site.<br>

Two Way Web Directory</a></b></font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal;">
<font size="3">Creating a new decentralized, collaborative web is
useless if users don't have an easy way to find and navigate to
content that interests them. The challenge, however, is how to
provide a centralized place for users to search and find content
without creating a single point of failure or control in the network.
The Two Way Web Directory solves this in several ways.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal;">
<font size="3">The Two Way Web Directory is actually a virtual portal
built into the browser which pulls its data from the P2P Mesh and the
tagging metadata entered during site creation in the New Site Wizard.
This site looks and feels something like a centralized Yahoo,
but is in fact completely peer-to-peer. </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal;">
<font size="3">The user-interface for the Two Way Web Directory has two
major ways of allowing users to find and navigate to sites. The
first is through search, so that users can enter terms into a
Google-like search box and find sites that match their interests. The
search engine actually initiates a search into the P2P Mesh,
using the various kinds of metadata and content that were entered
into Two Way Web Sites as described above, such as site tags, page
tags, automatic indexation, etc. The automatic indexation plays a
dual role of making it possible for every site to be quickly
searched, since they are already all indexed.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal;">
<font size="3">The other major user-interface is for an automatic
Yahoo-like directory to be created using site tags, a folksonomy:<br>
<br>
</font></p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img
 style="width: 1024px; height: 768px;" alt="The Two Way Web Directory"
 src="images/directory.png"><br>
</div>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal;"><font size="3">These
site tags are organized alphabetically and by
popularity, using a Flickr-like UI. The P2P Mesh itself also stores
information so that Related Tags can be gleaned, allowing users to jump
from one site tag to another to find other sites that match
their interests.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal;">

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; text-align: left;"><font

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal;">
<font size="3">This paper began with a series of questions: What if
transparent collaboration were a part of web browsers and the web
itself? What would an extremely integrated network look like, with
instant messaging, site creation, and more all integrated into one
whole? Finally, what would this network look like if despite the
integration it was extremely decentralized? </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal;">
<font size="3">Paper Airplane and the Two Way Web are one answer to
these questions, empowering end users with a powerful suite of
collaboration technologies: Instant Site Creation provides one-click
production of online sites; The Editor is a powerful tool to get work
done with others and an answer to what an Internet-centric office
suite could look like; the P2P Mesh makes it possible to
transparently provide site creation, storage, naming, and saving with
zero end-user hassle; the Instant Messaging sidebar allows real-time
communication with site members while browsing and during
co-operative editing; the Smart Browser technologies standardize
navigation tools necessary to make these collaborative sites
accessible and organized in a bottom-up, organic process; and
finally, the Two Way Web Directory provides users with a virtual
centralized location to search and find sites that match their
interests.&nbsp; Even better, all these components work together to
create a system that is more powerful than the sum of its parts.<br>
</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal;">
<font size="3">Once a vision like Paper Airplane is enunciated,
however, it is
important to not try to build it. Instead, bits and pieces of it
should be taken and drastically simplified, with a strong focus on
pragmatism and integration into existing systems. Ted Nelson's
Xanadu is a cautionary tale of what can happen when someone attempts
to build a grand vision; grand visions are meant to stimulate
thinking in new directions, not to be built. </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal;">
<font size="3">Though this paper is focused on creating a vision that
pushes our current technological capabilities, it is useful to ask
whether the system could be built today as described. Significant
engineering and social challenges exist in creating the full Paper
Airplane and Two Way Web; peer-to-peer technology is
certainly not up to the job of building the kind of P2P Mesh
described, and fundamental reliability, security, and performance
issues might prevent it from ever being created. The current web is
also quite entrenched, and current trends are towards smaller and
lighter web browsers that integrate less features rather than more
monolithic, integrated ones. Some of the metadata features, such as
site and page tagging and the Smart Templates, might be susceptible
to spamming and gaming.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal;">
<font size="3">However, a great deal of very pragmatic systems can fall
out of Paper Airplane. This vision can be sliced and diced into more
realistic forms in many different ways that are all quite
interesting. Some possibilities:</font></p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal;"> <font size="3">Instead
of integrating these technologies into the browser, they can be brought
into existing server-side Wiki systems using DHTML/Ajax technologies,
with the P2P components dropped in favor of conventional client/server
systems. For example, the Navigator and Instant Messenger sidebars can
be
created with advanced HTML and served-up along side a next-generation
Wiki that has a much more powerful editor, similar to the advanced
editor described in this paper.</font></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal;"> <font size="3">Portions
of the Smart Browser can be broken into seperate, small FireFox plugins
developed by different people, with simple server-side APIs and
standards for how these browser-side Smart Browser widget work with
the remote site. For example, if a Search Smart Browser component is
integrated into the browser, remote web sites could implement a simple
RESTian or XML-RPC API to be searched in a consistent way
by this particular Smart Browser component. </font> </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal;"> <font size="3">The
Paper Airplane Browser component could be maintained, but could be
modified to work with centralized hosting services run by Google or
Yahoo rather than P2P systems, for example. In this case users and
businesses get a powerful collaboration-focused next-generation web
browser, but all the functions that were handled by the P2P system
instead happen in the centralized computing cluster maintained by a
business. New APIs to link the browser to the server could be created,
or could use WebDAV and Dynamic DNS for the New Site Wizard, automatic
domain naming, and editing
to maintain portability and fairness when moving between different
storage providers.</font></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal;"> <font size="3">Paper
Airplane and the Two Way Web can act as an end-user research goal for
the pure P2P research that is occuring as part of projects like the
IRIS
(Infrastructure for Resilient Internet Systems) NSF program, a very
strong end-user product to ground theoretical P2P ideas and provide an
easy to understand, visible justification.</font></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal;"> <font size="3">Aspects
of the P2P network could remain, but might simply augment and enhance
the end-user's experience rather than work to replace the existing web.
For example, if the browser has an Instant Messenger client it could
use a spontaneous P2P network between all Paper Airplane Browsers for
presence and routing, so that existing client/server web sites don't
have to be changed to support a new standard. A P2P Mesh can also be an
effective way to do DNS-like naming, for example, or act as a kind of
secondary cache for automatically BitTorrenting files above a certain
size on the existing web, for example.</font></p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal;">
<font size="3">Simple prototypes of the Two Way Web peer network and
the Paper Airplane browser have been created. An open source
implementation of the Two Way Web has been created as a prototype
framework named <a href="http://p2psockets.jxta.org">P2P Sockets</a>.
P2P Sockets is also an experiment
in creating a P2P network that exposes an API that is
familiar to existing programmers, namely the BSD Socket interface. It
also includes higher level ports of software such as web servers,
the Java Servlet and JSP APIs, XML-RPC clients and servers, etc. to a
P2P network, as well as a simple distributed implementation of the
Domain Name System. </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style=""><span
 style="font-style: normal;"><font size="3">A
<a href="http://paperairplane.us">simple browser prototype</a> has also
been created to mimic some of the
functionality of the Paper Airplane browser. This prototype is a
Mozilla plugin that allows people to easily create collaborative P2P
web sites, without setting up servers or spending money. </font></span></span>It
does this by integrating a web server into the browser itself,
including tools to create collaborative online communities that are
stored on the machine. The sites are stored locally on a user's
machine, and a peer-to-peer network using the P2P Sockets framework is
created between all of the
Paper Airplane nodes that are running in order to resolve site names
and reach normally unreachable peers due to firewalls or NAT devices.
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal;">
<font size="3">The Paper Airplane project is now finished, having
produced a vision and prototypes. Hopefully it has inspired you to
imagine what a new kind of web might look like.</font></p>
