<h2>Notice</h2>
<p>This site is part of the Paper Airplane and Two Way Web research project, which has produced 
its <a href="http://codinginparadise.org/paperairplane">final paper and report</a>.  This is a 
prototype and was produced to explore some of the ideas in the final research paper.  As the paper is 
finished so is this prototype; development is finished and support is not maintained any more for this 
code base.</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Paper Airplane is a Mozilla plugin that empowers people to easily create collaborative 
P2P web sites, without setting up servers or spending money. It does this by integrating a 
web server into the browser itself, including tools to create collaborative online communities 
that are stored on the machine. Paper Airplane Groups are stored locally on a user's machine. A 
peer-to-peer network is created between all of the Paper Airplane nodes that are running in order 
to resolve group names and reach normally unreachable peers due to firewalls or NAT devices.</p>

<p>Parts of Paper Airplane have been modularized into the <a href="http://p2psockets.jxta.org">P2P Sockets</a> project, a reimplementation of standard Java sockets on top of Jxta and ports of standard web servers, servlet engines, etc. to run on top of a peer-to-peer network.  P2P Sockets is at a 1.0 beta level, while Paper Airplane development is just beginning.  Paper Airplane code will be posted to this site as it is developed.</p>

<li><b>[6-15-2005]</b> - The Paper Airplane project is now finished and is no longer supported; this plugin
was part of a research effort to brainstorm and explore how the web and browsers could be different
if they deeply supported collaboration and decentralization.  <a href="http://codinginparadise.org/paperairplane">The final paper</a> for this project has now
been published.</li>
<li><b>[6-15-2005]</b> - A <a href="https://paperairplane.dev.java.net/docs/tutorials/plugin_screencast.html">demo screencast</a> has been created to see Paper Airplane in action</li>
